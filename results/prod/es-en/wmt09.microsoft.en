The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions of the shares of EEZ reached approximately half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of commercial Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday's fall when it fell to about 6%.
This time's drop is due to falling shares on Wall Street.
Here too, the market reaction to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives was expressed, which refused to support the financial sector secretary's stabilization plan.
Falling shares in Asia
Asian stocks on Tuesday experienced a dramatic drop, although throughout the day the index eventually dimted part of the losses.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Stock Exchange index throughout its financial day was almost four percent, although it later narrowed its losses by reducing the decline by nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows Chinese stock movements on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell by 3.8%, markets in Shanghai were closed.
Sydney Stock Exchange shares lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the secretary of the Index, fell to 3.6 per cent.
"Scheduled rescue actions in the U.S. are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world," said Hong Kong Mint Chief Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
American lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American stocks
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system aid plan to which $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion kronor) should be devoted.
Lawmakers, in this way, ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American stocks experienced a bloody bath and mainly the stock rate picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
Dow Jones' index dropped to nearly seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index fell before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly's proposal did not go ahead, the index began to fall freely.
Congress withdraws: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American finance system.
Your vote will take place earlier next week.
American lawmakers caused a gap in talks about the approval of the bailout plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion kronor).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and be voted on.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed on Monday at the Assembly of Representatives.
He told the Reuters agency on Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Financial and Banking Services.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be done in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the advent of ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a psychologically significant first factor for financial market revitalization.
Then, however, "deencanting" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market support will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a breakthrough.
We resolved our disagreed views on how the market stabilization package should take," Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met Sunday night with finance minister Henry Paulson to give the government Fund a definitive form.
It should buy from financial companies unsold mortgage assets that lead financial firms to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are about to close the plan convention, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to get on with the sanitation plan, but I think we're already on it," Paulson said.
A sign for Asian business
The global financial crisis expressly impacts the rapidly lowering stock market.
According to Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to finally approve a deal this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' businesses to the Asian finance market as these are those in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday's trade.
For now, however, there is nothing certain about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote and not even whether they will not stall at the last minute with any problems.
Lawmakers believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress may block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush valued the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president may veto this decision, but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was preserved to gain financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Sen. Judd Gregg said.
American President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is pleased with Saturday's breakthrough and that he values "the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armored contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said lawmakers decided on the responsibility of the program's money for protecting taxpayers' taxes from their losses, a relief closure of the scheduled finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armoured contracts for directors of the company participating in the program, and creates a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be run by the Ministry of Finance.
We have worked very it, and we have made a breakthrough towards the agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans, Paulson said.
The plan also features helping homeowners who struggle with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower monthly burdens on debtors' installment payments and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance's chief economist, David Marek, a good idea that will be made but quite difficult.
"And this is why it is not known by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"Much more important is that, already this week the congressmen agree on their support and give him his approval as much as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that this approval will be reached is, at the moment, the most important thing," Marek insisted.
Triumph of the populist right in Austria, together they make up 29%
Early elections to the Austrian parliament have led to the earliest results, an appreciable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition, and an expressive strengthening of the populist right party.
Heavy and special losses have suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously reeling.
Instead, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of carinthia's state government, J. Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, social democracy (SP) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent votes, losing a 5.5 percent vote compared to the last election of 2006.
Worse, the OVP has ended, losing 25.6 percent, nearly nine percent of the vote.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two major Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the popular ones who called this early election.
Even in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage when it came to preference over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation was heard about the resignation of the party president and, to this day, deputy chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe this could be reached at the party presidency's exceptional meeting on Monday.
Such developments would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and more approximate starting point of election results, i.e. the renewal of the grand coalition between SPO and OVP.
Given that the reinforcement of both parties on the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and BZO, eleven percent of the vote - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would be repeated from 1999 when the popular negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit , but in 2005 it was demearated from BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction on the part of the European Union.
For this evolution, Haider, who has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and who is already taking his return to Vienna, to national politics, is clearly committed.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and was relegated from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four per cent limit and is therefore not part of parliament.
Armed Hand Fight: MP3 Player vs. Mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player manages to make calls.
Which seems clear that it's better to buy only the phone.
Yet there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends practically on the way it is used and the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album on it.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP records no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz or blues music are slashed on their shelves, you're probably dreaming of at least this type of record player.
This is the same with music that is on its way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - MP3 music.
And here are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kronor on a player, as well as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the twenty-crowned flea helmets.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also decides battery life
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even what not even most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most basic functions such as phone, send messages, you can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse photography device and can even get you to browse.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PODs are going to have in their pocket also a small computer.
This is a small miracle as no fridge knows how to make a barbecue and no TV can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile before the display indicator will light up asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest drinks of energy.
Few mobile phones manage to play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly have higher performance.
So keep in mind that cheap mobiles won't play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, above, call constantly get still, for more safety, a charger for work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the worst ones withstand at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem happens when recording music on mobile.
Unfortunately only part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly to the memory card but only on some non-reduced reading units can the small memory cards used in mobiles be connected.
On players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Simply fill the device with music via your computer's USB.
Most mobiles and players create their order alone in the music library based on the performer's name, album title, genre or also user rating.
Some devices only display a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, operating system smartphones).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment be interested in the strength of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to the music as a background and you will listen to it every day just for a while, as on the tram, then it is enough for any mobile you play.
What virtually any mobile really achieves.
You shouldn't even be interested in the format in which your phone or player plays the music.
The MP3 is played by everyone and practically all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it most of the devices play music in WMA format.
The less include the AAC format (a format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is sufficient through the mobile internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could on its own be a weighty argument for purchasing a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of operators is miserable and most are limited only to the fleeting success issues of radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a cell phone.
Whenever you feel like hearing something, you'll find your phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones with you or at least handsfree headphones.
If not, you can use a built-in player that has virtually every mobile even at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be its price.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand kronor you can now acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of a classic headphone input.
The best, even when it comes to the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5mm input. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is nothing more than their easy service.
The simplest players - by no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are actually handled by anyone.
The minimum functions, their handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the turntables is evident.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with mobile and, consequently, gigantic data downstream account.
Which device to decide on
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card you will reach two thousand kronor.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped only with a card of 2 GB maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and want to buy a cheap MP3 player yet, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) no more than 1,100 kronor is required.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding music lovers take care of the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman line have almost identical use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, about four thousand kronor, but with a higher capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand cited more arria brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not going to be long before we get there.
That Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it in mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office ( T) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is among the most expensive in the whole Union.
After the european Commission's last steps in the field of roaming fee regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely to be reached - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper than if they are sent from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic will remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
We probably find this paradoxical, as we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, Pavel Dvo-ak, has already stated that there is no longer room in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market led to a significant price decline to which classical operators had to react as well.
At the same time, even before sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the British market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It was shown that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
Otherwise, you don't have to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we inform you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
After only half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on many more specific target groups.
In addition, much fewer customers than a classic operator can function effectively.
They do not bear relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world such virtual operators usually come up with low expenses - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that however, are often counteracted with the offer of tighter services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers at least half as cheap SMS from the competition.
However, as Mobilking's example in Poland shows, it can also be a good blow to a trivial goal group.
This operator is specifically aimed at man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - he's the operator he likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if similar concept like Poland's could hook in our country.
This is doubted by Vodafone's spokesman, Miroslav Epick: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, from the point of view of the supply of services is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there is no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be any virtual operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech R. it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it's Mobilking's launch in other countries in our region," he said in telephone conversation for mobil.cz, Jana Studni-ková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
Indirectly he assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, in order to offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly encountered all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have made progress in the meetings," said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe they'll flash better times.
It appears that, for unofficial information, the first official operator would possibly have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
To this day no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this area," mobil.cz, Vlastimil Sr.e., spokesman for Telefónica O2.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional compliance with O2's opinion, adds: "To this day we have not registered any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop."
He adds: "On the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find a virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table some concrete contract that could be studied in such a short horizon"
Vodafone draws its attention rather to meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Epick adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
We consider it to be the greatest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field lies in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on mobile."
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a price drop and thus a decline in profits.
So why facilitate entry into the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull the same rope, proof of that is the agarrón when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on the T-Mobile was at the time of U:fon's entry by T-Mobile.
This is attested by the public information accessible on the websites of the T.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: "In addition, it is not long ago that the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
As regards the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that another player's entry into the market would mean great requirements for him and, above all, for his services."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the position of the ATT, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in trade tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (OHS).
However, it expressed its typical stance on this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after an agreement was closed on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator.
To date, no agreement has been closed as the offer of potential stakeholders was rather not interesting enough for classical operators," Kristián Chalupa of the foreign affairs department of the OHS added to our question.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers, this is more than just consideration, other than that they should note that no one takes advantage of their market position.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their market entry contributed to the price drop of mobile phone services"
Clearly, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and the fall in prices do not fall within the interest of the OHS.
Really dramatically shocking in this whole case lies in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it is really a coincidence, is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline at gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a tough fight for competition.
"The Office in this regard has found no signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position therefore do not have a corresponding rise in responsibility in their market actions.
The tools needed to open up the mobile phone market to virtual operators are rather lacking, as well as telecommunication regulators," Chalupa added to his response.
Interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of conflict.
Clearly, there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by the T-T according to which telecommunications are, from the point of view of commercial tendering, a single market.
In this type of market of course none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile operator - with all its logic - has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument were not accepted, at least for OHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators are strikingly up in a similar way.
The current complaints of the interested parties (including the company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with operators they are clashing with many similar impediments.
Loading responsibility in the T'T is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the OOHS washes its hands on this whole thing.
We've met him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law for the extension of the competence of the IT in the field of commercial tenders was recently submitted which did not take effect, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This should be well known by the representatives of the OHS, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
Everything goes well, when no one looks
At the same time, something like a pseudovirtual operator that already exists in Czech mobile networks already exists on Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services that, however, only part of them are public.
These are usually companies engaged in multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Normally only some chosen get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of it ordering a lot of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If cases such as the ones you cite were to be discovered, you could talk about infringement under the terms of contract that could result in an end to collaboration with the given company," Martina Kemrová replied.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity by mobile operators would not reach people responsible.
It is precisely in the case of the three undertakings mentioned that they can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they make a not inconsiderable profit and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Epick warns us of possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a large percentage of customers.
They must also accept that their phone's SIM card is not in their name so they can't absolutely dispose of it as a normal carrier customer."
This is precisely what should seem to the at least strange It.
In addition, a new question for the OHS appears.
If mobile operators screw their eyes into this type of procedure, why are they blocking the virtual operator's entry?
It should be added that theOHS has enough competence to discover such activities and if it is not going to want it should not be content with the operators' explanations that they have no idea of this story and that their trading conditions do not allow it.
When we'll stop being the most expensive
As has already become clear in the text, the virtual operator's entry into the mobile market led to a significant decline in service prices.
At the same time, in virtually every country where the virtual operator emerged, classical operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this break-in.
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases defended operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure they managed to bring about the first virtual operator and with it others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body all this case happens as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot fail to be impressed that the confusion of the attributions in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market is likely to start moving again.
If any of the operators lets in any mobile operator, it will be difficult for the OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling it more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four performances of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, My Home.
The new anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jisí B'lohlávek.
Four versions are available - two versions that are Solos, one male voice and one female voice, one with Choir and one instrumental.
The singing is handled by Katesina Kn'ínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn's arrangements are Otakar Jeremiá and Jaroslav Krsek.
All four versions iHNed.cz listen to the server.
He regards this national Czech song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio has said earlier that it intentionally chose for single singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried with both of them and then, too, with the Choir to look at the diction so that the text would be well understood, so that it would be consistent," he said.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home first sounded in 1834 on the tables of the State Theatre in Josef Kajetán Tyl's original Czech play Fidlovaska and arranged with the music of Frantyek Akroup.
It gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first verse of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 naturally became a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
Prague's MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company instead of a paper ticket.
This can currently be purchased by almost a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual bonus (this will be valid from January 1, 2009) and simultaneously load it into their chip card at the infocenters and positions of the transport company at Metro stations, Muzeum, Mstek, Nádra-í Hole-ovice, Andel, Roztyly, Let-any, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Ka-erov and Luka.
Bonuses can be purchased from yesterday on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely start forgetting about ticket stalls at subway stations, where until now they had to regularly queue to get a regular ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard is recharged at one of the thirteen subsidiaries of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is at the disposal of passengers a window with prepared staff that helps those interested with the online purchase and also with the top-up of the voucher purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to top up the electronic voucher on the Opencard at the automatic vending machines found in some metro halls.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, they remind us of a ticketing machine and travelers will probably have already noticed them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Bud-jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in town but by the end of the year there would have to be eighty," Opatrn's completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
Using the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will be charged only to it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on ring trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 mainly used by the inhabitants of the towns of Central Bohemia.
"On trains attached to Prague's integrated transport there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the bonus area," explained the control of tickets, Filip Drapal of the Ropid organization that sets the timetables for prague's bus transport.
The ring buses have their reading cards mounted at the driver's locker.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany him with the Opencard in the place intended for this purpose on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonuses there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drapal completed.
Passengers who do not travel on ring buses and do not remember when the validity of the voucher ends up can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
The German Sudetes requested in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is drawn from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the Board of Trustees of the United States of America.
With this wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans presumably addressed the president of the United States in 1945.
It results from the letters that are stored in a particular file and that are now stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Krumlov request in a letter to the American president that he does not allow the return of the "Aumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are arriving on German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry the fate of Aumava in their hearts."
Given that Czechoslovakia's union with the southeastern Germans presumably implies - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in the brutality, disreeration, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors pray in the letter to the American president to assume for today and forever Aumava under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants it gives us to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all collaborates with the victory of allies," he writes in the letter.
The reason why authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of retaliation from "Czech oppressors."
If the president of the United States presumably doubted this idea of the Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under his board of trustees in the U.S. lands.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of post-war history, may sound a little childish to us, some specialists rightly paint the expectations of the Germans of the Southeast at the time.
Although the Czech Germans must have sensed minimally that it would be about their expulsion from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate for the Sudetes some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who was born in eeské Bud-jovice.
He was in the war, as a German from Bud-jovice, enlisted in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war he was ceded by the British and placed in the Holstein prison camp dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that when they came home, the Czech would do them good," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, he said, had that on the basis of the Benes Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could characterize the emotional Campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch in the media on Wednesday.
The minister's office, Alea'ebí-ek promises that it will deter drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will be felt in television, radio, film, the internet and brochures.
I'd have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind you that before you get going, your seat belts are fastened.
It wants to raise awareness above all of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and lastly also professional drivers.
And what can we see in ads?
Fundamentally human stories that embed emotions.
And for this we are attested by the "bloodthirsty" ads throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "You Don't Think" is written in large letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pay."
This should symbolize that man in a moment of despising can come to pay with his own life.
Ads are going to "fear" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises that this will reduce accidents and the death toll on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"For drivers it's worth the sugar and whip system.
Sugar is for him when, for example, he passes a red light and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says Na Homolce hospital transport psychologist Martin Koaán.
And that is why it is necessary an information campaign in the press and mainly a negative publicity, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of dangers.
"If there are any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Koan warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of Israel's provisional government, Ehud Olmert, ruled on the restitution of virtually all land occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that on Monday he appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to restore almost all (occupied) land if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll keep a certain percentage of these lands, but we Palestinians will have to be given a similar percent (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that Jerusalem would also be included in the event of restitution.
"He who wants safety in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city where there were several dead and dozens of people were wounded.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for temple hill, sacred and historical place" located inside the ancient city.
"Anyone who wants to maintain Israelite sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work," he later insisted.
Withdrawal of the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for closing a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria solely on the basis of the Golan withdrawal," he warned.
"Syrians know well what they will have to get rid of to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with the Hezbola (Cheetah movement), they must detach thee from the ongoing support of the terrorism of Hamas (Cheetah movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India for illegally collecting beetles could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is how the minister in New York stated, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this were not resolved then yes, then this cooling would surely be reached," he noted after the meeting that was organized on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get into legal matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Avácha, who was exempt from indictment and punished with a fine, the government could negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
It would be best for Emil Kusera, sentenced to three years in prison, according to Mukherjee to appeal to the highest courts.
You can then apply for a waiver of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself on the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises appealing to the High Court and then a pardon would be possible," the Head of Czech Diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convicted "legal competent support," the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already achieved by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining with India the best relations, which have a long tradition.
The Indians recognize it too," Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the TK said, before his colleague he insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really think it's wrong to imprison and convict these Czech scientists," he announced.
The minister eluded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I've received quite a few promises, " he only found.
Questions after the accident: Are stewardesses illegal on buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near the Italian city of Padova we get the question of whether the stewardesses and passengers can get around the bus during the trip.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the stewardess's activity is contrary to road traffic law," says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place of the vehicle despite having two other places booked.
However, the bus may have an accident or brake suddenly, and at the very moment the stewardess delivers coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with places on foot.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no room to stand, which was confirmed by the company's director, Radim Jansura, Aktuálně.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was removed and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat," he told us about his position.
The stewardess doesn't know the law.
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the stewardess - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law is only aware of the term Vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Road Traffic department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorno, thinks on the contrary that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have walking sites.
That's it," he says.
Buses are divided among the urban ones, where there are places to stand and of limited top speed, intercity with places to stand with a higher speed permit and those of long distances without places to go standing, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says the expert
BESIP's expert in Transport Safety, Jaroslav Hosín, sees no major problems regarding the movement of the stewardess on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
Even here you are not sure that the turbulence arrives and that the stewardess can be hit on the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly brakes, it is evident that the physical laws are valid.
Same as on a city bus or tram.
The security of the stewardess must be solved by the carrier's rules of procedure," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jansura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier offering the stewardess service.
Use two hundred in it.
The director, even after the accident, considers that job risky.
"However, the moment I get the impression that the stewardess position is risky, then I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers upon entry.
It would save even expenses," he says.
In the interest of safety is why Asiana lacks stewardesses in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have stewardesses, we're against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago to Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy happened
In the accident of the line that joins Naples died a young stewardess of Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus. without using the flashers.
His driver tried in a quick manoeuvre to avoid it, however, he collided with the front right.
Jansura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the flight attendant's break were sold.
"These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but awaits financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision to the movement of the stewardess on the bus in which thirty expert members of a Ministry of Transport group have been working for a year.
"However, they have not reached any concrete conclusions.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on motorway and the use of mobiles during the march," says expert Hosín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewardesses something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers," with spokesman Hanzelka ending, that bus safety control is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Security at work.
A Czech referees a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, in which Australia is depicted surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a small lost point in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is at the same time as large as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
Its head, director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this type and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed hides to this day a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to this day that themselves carry the key to the development of cancer drugs.
The bottom is greater than the mainland
The countries with the coast have today begun to vehemently contest the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the so-called Continental Edge which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the given country's coast.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all resources of the Continental Rim.
"Simply, continental edge means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent underwater.
It reaches the edge of the sea coast, and often to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone," mikulka explains.
The request made by the given country to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continent edge, must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of job preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist help committee.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only those of the last three countries mentioned have made their way," Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine dominance.
However, New Zealand also succeeded - the seabed area granted to it by the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, or almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries reversed millions of pains for their study.
The gain to be detached from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, invaluable.
Other states are also slowly submitting their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Treaty of Montego Bay".
Wherever the continental edge ends, the ocean floor region declared by Treaty as "the common heritage of humanity" begins.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is no gold mine," Director Mikulka says with emphasis adding "that their separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and their regime defined by contract."
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is divided with other countries of the then East Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
He achieved this in 1991 with a Treaty as investors the same as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to explode in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it's kind of like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"An area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretion deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian division employee, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
Dusseldorf's hope rests in Frankfurt
There is no shortage of big words in the letter from west LB's board of directors for its employees.
By merging The Dusseldorf Bank Units with DEKA Bank you can form 'a central capital market of Sparkassen's financial group', as the brief says, published on Monday
The West LB bank, breaking the 'competition bloco' with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
Moreover, such a merger may be a beginning for further mergers in the field of regional banks.
Thus he comes to understand the text, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in tough times.
Because just like before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also from the federal institute for financial services surveillance which has recently made clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the Francfort side, there has been much talk about the union of such a kind between DEKA bank, which Sparkasse's clients know for their investment funds, and the West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, let it known that he sees no meaning in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Strasse, with a regional bank such as the Helaba or the West LB.
But the BOARD of Directors of DEKA, which is now composed of sparkassen's regional banks and associations, commissioned the board of directors to begin negotiations with the West LB on common business activities.
In this it could be a business in the capital market or a few parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, as it is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in Sparkassen's field, the name of the DEKA bank appears, which with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and with the Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was left to no results.
As soon as the plans became public, Hesse's government spoke out against the Helaba's involvement in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-W'rttemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally, the chairman of the Helaba's board of directors, Gonther Merl, said he was against the plans for coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of that, it seems clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Well, when the Bavarian parliament elections are going to pass, BayernLB's union with the regional bank in Baden-W'rttemberg could make progress.
For the Ice Cream, that's not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to fuse, Helaba will be short of partners to do that.
In the south the bank could be only a young partner, although until now it knew much better from the financial crisis that the Stuttgart and Munich real estate did.
On the other hand the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 per cent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided the plans of coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form are only part of it.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband so far gave no answer.
In the end the West LB can be broken down, but that, of course, is not the bank's own desire.
Thus, also in the letter from the bank's board of directors it is said that an attempt would be to find a complete solution for the whole bank
Since coexistence between unique parts of the bank can be combined with the DEKA, that will show the time.
Oktoberfest's second weekend is known as "the weekend of italians"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca and the third or fourth.
But this time, he is attended by Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-litre barrel of Kaiser-branded beer is built a huge bear tiger showing almost 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds know how to produce in their throat.
First Elena pats Luca, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the car park next to Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses depart, 'direction Munich, the beer festival', expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are mainly planned for Italians, a bus is for Brazilians only.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing the South Americans, they had already started celebrating at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing to Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver-colored sideburns, owns these buses.
For five years they have been coming to Oktoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 a.m. turn.
Spending the night there means just unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including receiving the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the Bavarian Purity Law, health insurance and german guidance- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the way on the motorway with the direction "Brennero"
No beer, not yet.
Quickly the tranquility reigns on the bus, travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian license plate take another break on the highway 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco's group has the expected arrival at 6.30am in the car park next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to it in Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors of the tent open, that means march!" shouts Marco in the early morning.
"March!" March and occupy the back places in the tent.
"Don't take the front places, because we're going to block, and all in yellow caps don't sit on the same bench, scattered all over the space!"
One liter of beer, Marco roars, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he leaves his place, he'll be busy!"
Third, "This afternoon at exactly ten-thirty you have to get here!" you understand?
And now everyone's going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow caps in the trees, traffic signs and even on an election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You wish you could recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no accurate data on the number of people; these are 50,000 people who make the journey over the Alps and tormentally enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
Munich police receive help from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross which makes a statistic of the nations present, where Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assists) and Austrians take the top spot.
The favorite shop in the Italian campaign is thus called Hofbruuzelt.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, accentuated only last week by Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbruck.
That the politician would use the word "relatively" and added that the German banking area will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich's property financier, which is listed in the DAX index, receives a billion-dollar credit from a consortium of German banks to be able to resist market turbulence.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to EUR 35 billion.
The portion of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate will use has to yield interest.
The money comes as well as from private banks also from those of public law.
The cause of that is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was lent to long-term projects financed them only a short period - which is now, because of mistrust in markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year, the bank's cash reserve has fallen by 95 per cent, 2.37 million euro, and the equity share was also slightly 1.6 per cent behind 1.45 per cent.
Compared to the same period last year, continued financial investment income and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero, imputation income for debtors and some securities also in the dissolution of credit business provisions tended to fall by more than 70 per cent at 5 million euro.
Only thanks to high and high income from reimbursements of compensation costs for the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as interest reimbursement under the federal tax code and businesses organized for consortium companies, could the negative balance result in a deficit of approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financier was initially lost in speculation with industrial credits for real estate, which served as a reason for the founding of the Aareal bank.
As not much money could be made from financing state projects, the Defa began to devote himself intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private and as well as state(Private-Public-Partnership PPP) investors and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make depreciation on the value of the subsidiary that will have an "essential material effect" on the group's consolidated profit and loss account, it is said very vaguely.
It's a fact that dividends have been canceled.
By 2007 they were cancelled to two-thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial financier in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own client deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a portion of the Defa's credit portfolios from its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a credit the need for the group's financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international money markets that are now essentially unfit to function"
Other sources say that thanks to this money refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the Board of Directors of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Surveillance (BaFin) are on the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That's what the bank's shareholders and creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no record.
It is even imaginable that you don't have to need the financing in its full volume.
But the opposite cannot be excluded.
Word was running that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost in insolvency, so temporary salvation cannot reassure at least concerned people either.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While priority debts almost do not change, borrowing courses based on position in the property register clearly tend to go down.
In particular, the borrowings of the former subsidiary of W'rttemberg Hypo are concerned and, rightly, the borrowings whose maturities exceed 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its borrowings that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are under-affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime you can start from pension repayment in time.
Or something is going to happen, which no one risks imagining - the financial crisis is going to go over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial stature, now the security that is already at its limit became a justified hope.
That's going to be a reason, because creditors will spend sleepless nights, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation from enthusiasm.
Even short-term investors can put the end and use new-account transportation of losses for upcoming benefit compensation tax payments on the change in the future.
During the release of the hostages the German special forces command was at the place of action
To solve the hostage crisis, Egypt's government had asked for Germany's help - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are being known about the circumstances of the liberation of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the action of salvation, german special forces also participated indirectly.
Thus at the place of liberation were specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, aircraft squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation also experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As ministries spokesmen reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
Egypt's government accepted Germany's help to use it as on-site support.
"Fortunately that moment did not come," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, assailants had hijacked a group of travellers consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the abduction in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the saved people who were safe and sound arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He said no words about the details of liberation.
At first in Berlin there was no information on their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return on Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent?-Box
When on the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at the Highschool in Tachibana the girls started laughing: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word manga - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was afraid.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in kawasaki direction and go by train 40 minutes to Highschool Tachibana.
Alone I had to find my way, luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not set as rigorously as in my home in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before class started, I'd had to introduce myself.
Besides, I'm not a person who speaks gladly in the audience, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt of the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, that's how dressed I got to the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything in the right way: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this time I was very happy because I had started studying this language for two years now.
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and made signs and all along I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my Sleeves.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "cute, cute"
Then I quickly slid into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone was talking at the same time, laughing and asking a lot of questions - at the same time it's very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then at recess they all took out their Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring pieces of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and seaweed, fruit and something like tofu dough meat.
In most cases I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Things are weird and have a new flavor.
What's certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of plums marinated in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to her in hope that she can get to know him better during a recess.
That's what I read about in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see him here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
Finally for years I prefer to read Mangas.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying some Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I will travel there.
Also because I have a skinny by tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
Since everything is well organized, I still didn't feel lost here even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
U.S. House of Representatives does not approve of the salvation package
The first chamber of the United States Congress let a large $700 billion saving package for financial markets fail with little.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's package for saving financial markets with 227 votes against 206.
Despite all appeals from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties, he did not reach a majority for the program with which financial market disorder should be limited.
With dramatic action, desperate advocates had still tried to convince critics to accept the large $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked MPs to take a vote even though the plan is not as popular.
"It's hard to get political approval to avoid something that hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of this was investor concerns that the state save package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
To let the program into force it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling danger flees, why has it feared too?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control whether they, behaving in a way similar to us, feel the same way?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years, contributions from famous scientists have been published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or someone else being able to prove it until now, although we can't even prove that other people have a conscience.
But in this case we can at least expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about the sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: it becomes dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, which some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to spread our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include circuits associated by human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their participation in short memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This large part is much more developed in the case of people than that of the other primates and seems to be absolutely missing from other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from other primates.
An other particularity lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is linked to the language, often that means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness would not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created however, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That's why it's hard to explain how other animals' consciousness works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with big problems.
Most of my interventions relate to the content of the consenting experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without regard to their contents, and that is what happens during short memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick the essential happens rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to causal mechanisms: The two may or may not be similar.
Interestingly this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for visualization formation.
And what does that result from for sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when brain activity occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
Seen from this point of view the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature they follow classifications of fine feelings because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar so that we can describe the states of others along with ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the other hand, thinks that sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for body feelings and brainstem, so thinks Jaak Pankseep, but concentrates more on the brainstem.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretic reasons I can't go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, that may feel in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same way?
Seeing danger, a cockroach flees, so why is he afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of the behavior does not yet prove the likeness of experience.
That's true that neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is it the brainstef trunk that is responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to prove it for men: How can you prove it in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally distinguished from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as the same is measured by rats and men.
Since I don't research the tongue and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You can say I don't see beyond my nose, but I'd rather move forward than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA Platini President: Grace Period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said preparations would soon take place under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government looks at UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine's ability to organize the European championship along with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and in both countries there is much to do."
The schedule of construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums is going to be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work with great speed," said Ukrainian association president Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is not going to take its eyes off us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The commission met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN is unable to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season were many clubs in the first division condemned due to manipulation in relegation to the lower category, eventually also the division council had to be postponed.
Organizers record the increase in the number of bookings
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened juncture, the Germans' desire to travel remains as before.
As the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin reported on Monday, with travel reservations for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to research by the GfK Market Research Institute, reserves for the autumn months had already risen in number.
So the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures which are the information analyzed on bookings in 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar, especially travel to the United States is in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased by almost a third.
The Germans' favorite destination points are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and feed prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better calculated for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with advance booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so the volume of sales compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, comparing last year, fell.
Dennis Quaid's outraged counterattack
She wanted to promote a new film, talked in an interview about private life - and struggles with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan appointed her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The backward war of the two roses in meg's ex-partner Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with US magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of a marriage's failure is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his appointment as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard of by Meg how many times he tells the stories of our relationship in another version," the 54-year-old man told "New York Daily News."
Among other things it is very "regrettable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again "will remember in public the pain and changes, all that a divorce means for a child."
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is remarried and has recently been a twins dad.
And so he ends his statements by highlighting: "Whatever my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that's fine."
Air and hotel ticket prices are lowering
In the first half of 2008, air tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year's.
According to a current study, air tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
Air tickets and hotel overnight stays were made cheap again - this is the results of a study by American Express' travel service and financial services provider.
The company has analyzed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found a large change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays at many sites became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of Europe's 48 different cities increased on average to 6.9 per hundred.
From April to June prices have already dropped to 3.6 percent comparing last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was why "the interests of American tourists in traveling declined."
The decline in hotel prices is also noticeable much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices increased to 26.3 per cent, breaking a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, air ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Due to rising kerosene prices, Economy Class travelers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-distance flights even became more expensive to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, air ticket prices in Economy Class, compared to the previous quarter, dropped on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9, in the second half they fell to 23.6%.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even cut in half.
The cause of the price change is on the one hand the increase in the loose economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the air travel market demand is coming down.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the US. America and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit distance flights on airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 filed for bankruptcy - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With one goal and simple methods the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Borussia's Luhukay still doesn't come out to score the 14th goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he meant exactly reacting to what happened could be clearly read from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger whistled at the cockpit entrance of Hamburg Stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time ended and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was almost three decades physiotherapist of the HSV, enjoying a very great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That's why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded and raised his fingers in nod.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, Hamburg's head coach.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that wasn't done.
"Not everything was nice to see today," Marcell Jansen added afterwards.
Also Bastian Reinhard had wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) for its head impact; and also to the situation that gladbach's very weak team could not show all their strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory, " said Martin Jol summarizing.
This Monday the Hamburg SV is going to be 121 years old.
On Saturday of will be the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of board on the video screen.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," Marcell Jansen said.
It anticipates that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the speed of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The team with their players forced late as Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalter Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the team can't shine with their successes.
"We need more feeling and dribbling," Jol demands.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the festivities under the open sky in the endless spa, beer in one-litre jugs and famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a traditional Bavarian tailored suit.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there's one thing that brings us together: we're barely in a tent, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the pictures - it's very flattering especially since I'm first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap traditional Bavarian costume seems to fulfill its function.
Actually as a tourist in Oktoberfest from northern Germany my sense of well-being in a traditional Bavarian costume until this day was still limited.
But after we get to Teresa's Meadow, everything isn't that bad.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian costumes or leather trousers; no one seems to be heeding or feeling unpleasant -- everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
An muniquesa draws my attention to my apron that I had dressed in the wrong way: "the left part is single, half is the virgin, on the right side is compromised, behind is widow."
Or God, now I'm fastening from behind to the left.
"It's all right, " he says, laughing.
The others don't care about many of the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps where "To drink to get dressed!" is written and show, without asking them, their knot ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time at Oktoberfest.
He looks like "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
He tells me after he's put his glass of a liter of beer next door that he just drank.
He put it right next to the fire hydrant, most people think that's a garbage can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
The others aren't very lucky and can't consume as much alcohol.
At about eight o'clock at night, health care groups run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
Toilets appear each time as a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered walks from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: They come sober, they come back drunk.
You can't see who's suffering from the degrees of alcohol and he's on the walks.
"They are the ones who "can no longer," a toilet responded to my question and disappeared in tumult.
After the defeat of the vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
Early news of the failure of the banks' salvation package dropped down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest loss of points for a day in its history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
At about 20:30 one of the world's largest stock market barometers listed a 5 percent deficit in 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and was 1548 points.
At this time the biggest loser on the Dow Jones were American Express which lost nearly 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of nearly 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Goldmann Sachs bank shares lost nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a large investor Warren Buffet had participated financially in the company.
The plan of salvation envisages making available resources to buy so-called "rotten" mortgage shares.
But the sum is going to be paid at once but step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive stock option receipts for financial associations that during course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state's fund.
Courses in action in Europe and the US are in the middle of the world. U.S. keep coming down
Billion-dollar aid for banks in Europe and the US is a one-billion dollar government. The U.S. doesn't reassure investors.
The course of the shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate goes down and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the state-projected financial market's salvation, the US Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculated shares of The Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the fall in the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the savings actions of the federal government and private banks, the action of Munich's real estate financier a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6000 points and listed a deficit of 3.7 percent in 5,839 units.
Financial markets around the world have fallen.
The opening of the Wall Street day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion savings package will not be enough to give financial markets momentum.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bill of salvation, the Senate vote may be the first of October.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese main index Nikkei after profit fell to 1.26 percent in 11,743.61 units.
In Hongkong, the Hang-Seng index fell to 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the sensex main index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 units.
After the announcement of the capital increase, Arcandor's shares lost in the MDax.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim signed up to 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that stakes in Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a phenomenon mysteries causes bewilderment to researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity cannot be so correct.
The Ulysses space probe spent nearly 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now he is threatened by a death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes bewilderment among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they gain acceleration using the energy of a planet's gravitational field, for example from Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick just as the Ulysses Sun probe did.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles don't behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather, they frequent speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have higher or lower speed.
Physicist could not explain this effect until now.
He was called the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter to the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, solemnly believes now as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what astronomers remained in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter that can also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe have known the existence of Dark Matter for only ten years.
She supposedly possesses the force of attraction and her influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, Dark Matter makes at least one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As Italy's foreign minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be free.
Sudan's kidnappers had demanded millions of ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shootout during the liberation.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the point of attention of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper tells about the most important cases.
It appears that European tourists abducted in the Sahara are liberate.
On that, the same information is presented by Egyptian state television, Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After news of liberation on Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are liberated.
'Now we control his state of health,' Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are fine and in security, state Egyptian television reports.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on the way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the hostages were ousded: According to descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was fixed.
They agreed to the rescue," the guard said.
It was just about "receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six hijackers and two of them have been arrested in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany the ransom in the amount of six million euros; the money had to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to stay in custody until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
Germany's embassy in Cairo refused to take the position on this report.
Accident victim identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood was implicated in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Stepfather abuse "led to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assaults.
Truro's Royal Court, through an indegatory study, learned that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between the age of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and blindfold her before carrying out her sex acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms Randle, who spend much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some of Ms. Rande's friends had said about her, that having been a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead," as if she had "given up life."
In April 2007 his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his apartment in Plymouth.
Ms. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession concluding that said, "I used to tie her up and sell her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a dreadful experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer, if she hadn't, the issue probably wouldn't have ended up in court."
He added: "I have noticed the effect that according to Stephanie's description of Stephanie's father and mother the abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged by data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June is going to be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a working trip by the Ministry of Defence, abandoned two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention to delinquery.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought this was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause referring to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official must be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capacity of security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies face B&B price
In Britain, construction societies could face more than 80,000 pounds after the bailout/rescue of Bradford bank and Bingley.
The Government actually provided 14 trillion pounds to protect the deposits of the bank's 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use savers' money, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it "humiliating" that societies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 trillion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley's mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest accrued in the meantime is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial firms that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that issue.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved wisely ... call to pay today the price of institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and that mediation companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to 450 thousand pounds in 2009.
This means that societies will have to recover 81,000 pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, managing director of the Trade Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the housing market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent."
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction societies and their members from what could be a relevant price," Mr Cole added.
Interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of callable interests, which can be almost twice as much.
As mutually-building companies and there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
Turkey broadens diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey was inking to be a member of the European Union, European powers nested a desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 steps in inland Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha Train Station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, here's what the guides say.
The building is set to time the end of the platforms and carries in front two towers, one for each corner, all looking like a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in your complex is a bit decadent.
But once the locker was over the vault, there is no doubt what was the greatness of the company that this was the westernmost door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell under
British rule and when forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that this was sabotage.
Since then the station has declined and stayed out of history.
But today, this railway, gateway to Anatolia and all eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to broaden its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish government maintains excellent good relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To value the parameters of this new foreign policy, I climbed into a bunk bed and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, foreign policy expert, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jolt trip, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - new city, designed to rule a new secular state, away from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigmatic shift in the Turkish consensus
that has raised some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and "power bakeries" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet first thing in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is to re-integrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the east and west at the same time.
This is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point, " I ask, "Turkey might be forced to choose?"
"Turkey, " he replies, "you don't want to endorse that choice."
Next, it underlines one point that almost everyone I have spoken to up to that point had almost recited to me almost by heart: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with all the Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after a sleepless second night, my thoughts return to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How much would they have been surprised to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East would, in large part, be in Turkey's hands today?
And waiting for the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So there is not much doubt in what will be the continent to which this fascinating country must claim.
The price of milk rises from five pence per litre
The inhabitants of the Jersey stand will have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that the higher price of dairy products will rise by an extra five pence a litre from next Monday.
It is this year's second price increase, after a two-pence increase in February and followed by research conducted by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had increased before February was in 2002.
Denied bail to former Bangladeshi Prime Minister
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the application for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina that she can be taken to prison when she returned to her country.
His advocates said the court did not grant him bail by accusing an employer of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to an employer when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several corruption allegations at your expense.
Her long-tempo political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the military-supported government grant him full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is unclear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain released when she will return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail petition for Sheikh Hasina by arguing that she could not obtain bail because she was already being treated abroad on parole," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We are going to file an appeal against the Supreme Court order."
Her advocates argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after October 17, according to an Awami League leader last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, backed by the army, assumed power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatments.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges they are accused of.
Fears for the polio campaign in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan – the UN says - have been able to take advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while conducting vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge in ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission following the decision that required the company to reduce its participation in the rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Competition Appeals that it will have to reduce its 17.9% stake in ITV below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said BSkyB's interests hinder competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of the ITV stake raised doubts about ITV's independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the force to reduce its package in ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly why, BSkyB said, it would have surrendered its voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of Us attorneys
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special solicitor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Justice Department inspector general criticized the actions of administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Produrer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation have lied to investigators in an attempt to impede justice.
"Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special solicitor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from office by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for under-performance.
But it was later learned that lawyers had not evaluated the worse than other their colleagues, and many observers concluded that the fired ones would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
and can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
Successive head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from dismissals, resigned from his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General's report is highly critical of Mr Gonzales' role in the matter, and stresses how he had a "primary responsibility" for redundancies, which he "abdicated" from his leadership position and was "remarkably non-collaborative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, Bush's former collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic of great honor
Rock star Meat Loaf is going to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said that getting this recognition will be "an honor."
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group are running for this year's awards and ranking all four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability like the one used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and peaked at number 15 in the chart.
However, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf spent about nine years in the rankings and went on to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for his cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps prompt for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply on duty.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals, find it difficult to indicate the location of Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of Primiera Street – before I found Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than one active track.
No sign.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on Primiera Street
you want to revisaviment Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques you expect to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-fashioned neighbors who commented to be delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block's past before the appropriation of buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At this month's meeting of the Community Committee on Land Use, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in town, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, community district manager No.3, said.
"The city now owns very few spaces and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," Ms.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first emerged during this month's meeting
but Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, he didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a desire of the city to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is to develop the property without the management of that.
Compared to its more colored surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided between his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, was housed in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the property's photograph that comes out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The setting was magnificent," commented Danny Fields, the Manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about theburging of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a slit of the city that should be guarded.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Extinct Going"), has made available some of a talk about the city's history about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a slightly narrow, dead-end alley, dark also by day and marked by rusty iron warehouse doors and counter-windows, with old weeks-long newspapers blown along the gouts."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured across the back of the street and the door used to enter CBGB was kept nearby and now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22-oz were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested you could give it a cleaning.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life, " he said, "in dark, damp, disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old California studies associate and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a tough business.
Barack Obama's education proposals are an example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "African-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very certain consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "bilingual transitional education" for English-students.
However, the open issue for Mr Obama is whether the commitment to bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in overturning the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income family:
more than a third of students, many of whom newcomers, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively evaluated on the 2008 math test
and almost an equally astonishing 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than mr. Obama favored.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Plus, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the main one on Sixth Street, the school's approach to english instruction to students is in "total immersion."
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like the latter who have come from Mexico and that, if you enter the classroom 12 months later you would not be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a replicating model for other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubts about the response, but the idea of his party's politicians on the issue of education (the Associations for National Education have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their same constant support for dark bilingual education predicting Mr Obama's response.
While it is that immigrants must learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English
and instead, he said, "you should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil price falls sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil fell dramatically on Monday because of concerns that the American bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil stocks decreased from 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped from more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, before falling back once again because of huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety took hold of investors, once again, on Monday, despite congressional leaders who said they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the wachovia Corporation's banking operations, according to what the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, over the frantic weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout agreement "seem unable to revive market sentiment."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected to reduce demand for commodities, including oil.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rates are becoming increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption drops due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast for lower oil and gas prices is 20% by 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
Having spent, for the last eight seasons, longer than anyone else in the Jets uniform, playing defense, Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then he saw things unfold in the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned an scoreless game into a deflating game.
"I've never seen anything like it, " remarked Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazily under the gloomy clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles setting a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, when the evolution of relationship between the players had a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one of these when one cornerback fell and another came in with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way, " said Favre from all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a one-player devil.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were serving in the dam, the Cardinals' defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced foul by Warner.
In the last turnover, the fouls forced by Bowens could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked him 20 yards to win a final 34-0.
They're the biggest points the Jets ever made in a room.
To the team coach, Eric Mangini, ask him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "Second quarter or third quarter?"
When he was answered both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second quarter much more than the terzero.
They've earned a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Rested Gebrselassie tops world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated why many consider him the greatest runner in history, surpassing his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the 26.2-mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
Following the victory in the affluent flat race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has destroyed his previous 2:04:26 record in Berlin by 27 seconds, won last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the 26th world record in a race of impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the time trial race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing on average a few cutters 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since when track racers such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have converted over long distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
Clearly, the suspension left him cool, not rusty.
"I'm very happy, " Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I tinged some doubts, but in the end everything went well."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's African-Eastern rival - for the style of orchestrating his careers too much, in general, avoiding the encounter with many world marathon stars, based on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting the records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this critique does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the middle of the race at 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after their pacemakers declined.
But shortly before three miles from the finish line, Gebrselassie picked up one last boost to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi came to third place at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Britain's Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games so she was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her best record staff in nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made a smart calculus run, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to head and then recovering them after 18 1/2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and proof of life of color
Hidden by the park's expansion on the theme of greater Orlando, a few miles from the bright, noisy and colossal city, lies a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience remain very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and place of childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not a prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Ms. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – also making it a tourist stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression Season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Ms. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and who does not know what is missing."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has caught the eye to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the claim of blacks and a community of almost 2,400 people living below a double poverty level of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black South - sometimes sdared, others praised - that was born from slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and secretive.
And the concern about Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through central Florida often forgotten inward the story of blacks and human drama.
Having a cement face both in life and in literature, Ms. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Off the road on the left," he wrote, "there is the modern Marón public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardeners and playgrounds, manicured by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Ms Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Evidently, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls that Ms. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colorless songs about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that."
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, is remembered that when Ms. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud to dress with dignity today.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin continues.
But, she adds, swaying in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Ms. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Ms. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, no large public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Ms. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street in the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to it relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred closer to the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys would go around town throwing oranges and everything at the people sitting next door," Mr. Franklin said.
"They killed a girl too, once.
He was thrown into a watermelon in the car."
In a 1955 letter to Ms. Hurston she wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted rather than honored my race."
A Residents say today that the desegregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the confidence of their young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - they used to hug the teacher in the morning and evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and CEO Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because it was white -- there's a cultural gap there," Ms Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who went above prejudice, just as she did, with buoyant, trust and lines like: "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't get it."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Ms. Hurston's anonymous grave and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, a acclaimed robert E. Hemenway biography of Ms. Hurston appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her to American charges.
The road project came just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was going under the floodlights again.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Ms. Hurston to show what the county might ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride," Ms. Nathiri said.
Ms. Boyd put it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began appearing in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006, on a redesigned and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, you can sometimes feel like you're on a street from the past in a summer rain, in a city as small as the one founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Outsiders who come in search of Eatonville's history, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A Permit in advance is necessary to do most interviews, and some things - like murals in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fear that her da island community may be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of birth pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Ms. Hurston saw her entire race: beauty, and all problems, not better, not worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, silly and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, in case they dare to go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,'" says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it's a very nice city."
Over here in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from kiosks and gigantic television screens in Times Square, they wouldn't notice it being in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the honeycomb offices above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York face off daily with the worst "bad day of the office" since the 1929 slump.
Guys for home delivery keep ringing their metal tea carts across sidewalks and carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to crawl among tall apartment buildings, as well as human mules, with 50 eccentric stamped shirts hanging to a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their morning takeaway, and it's still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7pm on business days.
Employees are still waiting to queue for their bagel to the sellers' carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five o'clock in the afternoon on the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts out there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time it took for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not ahead of the employee's window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists look for instructions to go to Macy's department store and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "trusted personal banker," and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had still withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places where they had switched, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money out of so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction society), credit unions and savings banks in their hometown whose brancas only operate within the state of belonging, and who claim to treat customers like their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers were heading home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The office and store workers who stood before me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become finance experts in recent weeks.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her grieving-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter familiarly as if complaining about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, a fiftieth and somewhat janitor in uniform of my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopkeeper purchases.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "now I have all my savings in money market funds.
Switching is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Lives to remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Which Guildford music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent choir of young people, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were finishing our 20s - we just refused to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being changer of forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, regardless of whether unaccompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So you just have to sing!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never taxative, nor too florid.
Whatever the musical weeding, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
if any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that never, by any, I have been disappointed – otherwise I have often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two well-known warhorses around the world."
We'll be very short of it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequela by William Woodruff (25 September) you claim that "in 1946 he resumed economic history studies at Oxford and in 1950 he won a research grant from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctoral degree."
This is learned in a note by Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, overseen by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at universities in Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois for good.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career remains unknown.
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of austria's far-right freedom party and Belgian Filip Dewinter, affiliated with far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs representing mosques with a red line running through.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrated a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in Traun Cemetery near Linz sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was organized action.
Criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but investigators think this may have happened by attempting to hide the real motives of hate-driven extremists against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way election-related.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim religious when Ramadan was running out.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that grabbed nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burkas, and also voiced his opposition to foods considered to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties understand to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses conducted immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly for young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Ban on overseas travel for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police filed a ban on travel abroad last Thursday after magistrates had produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, but was represented by lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, September 25 at ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, police requested a readiness to prevent Mr Paul Gadd's travel abroad as well as to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, by virtue of being registered as sex offenders.
He has to inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent police said they wouldn't discuss glitter's individual case or possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all potential risks more effectively.
"Protecting kent residents is the main concern of Kent police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risks that may exist to the public."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When she was released Glitter flew to Bangkok, where she took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt unwell and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Magistrates' Court in Uxbridge, west London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Home Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and glad to learn that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
"I catch the master offstage to extract his character" Gonther Bauer_Fotógrafo
No heels, no frills, no opening suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
Put the artist aside.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments outside the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen gaze or the expressiveness of hands, carefree because they will not go on stage.
The German Gonther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser-known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different fields.
Included in the programming of The Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people but, when viewing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With the taste of the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1,997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plaque chamber.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material remember the classic photograph.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical basis of the image, confiding modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of dancing, singing or touching itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essentials, with the elf that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Well-known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter their life for a moment, whether it's a long or short moment.
I think inside photography portraiture is the hardest genre.
You meet or face people, characters, sometimes you don't even know, or who leave you only a few minutes to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco titled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the Gallery El Fotómata, located at number 20 Calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where it can be visited until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a recklessness"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to carry out the new project in which he works, a novel that stars Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalists who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The ever-favorite Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his time at the Hay Festival Segovia that today's project "is a recklessness" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If I were sensible, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it, and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days he has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the prominent figures of the third edition of the word party and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend"- filled the capacity of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Felix Romeo, he found before himself a dedicated audience to which the hour was made very short in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extrordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "living more than he lived"; how he writes in a "disciplined way" to supplement his "lack of inspiration" with intense documentation work, correcting and redoing much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced their vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which their stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more unhappy," so he called on writers to "not give up frivolity" and "take responsibility" for their vocation.
The weather undermines the Pozoblanco fair which also runs out of rejones
The feast of rejones that closed the pass of the Fair of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the announced rejoneadores that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the run.
Inclement weather has been baited with this fair, as finally two of its three festivities could not be celebrated.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bullfight.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a confinement of Castilblanco
So, only on Friday was there a celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and went out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante settled his two roasted with greetings and an ear, which gave more of the tendids than his bullfighting.
Worse still was El Juli, who passed through the coso of Los Llanos without sorrow or glory.
In his second bull, after a day of relief he won the hard time of a large part of the audience.
They skip a checkpoint in Alava in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
The agents stop the two occupants of a van and they are on the run.
His cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was not enough to stop.
The agents pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A. A. J., as reported in a statement by the Basque Government's Department of Interior.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public document.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a transport check on the N-1, as they passed through the municipality of Armiñón.
They were preparing to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated sharply and skipped control.
Officers began their chase until the vehicle stopped a couple of miles later on the shoulder, at which point their two occupants got close to fleeing the race through a wooded area.
The Ertzains eventually reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hash bales, so they proceeded to their transfer to police units for thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials found that the license plate had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the van's documentation, so the detainee has also been charged with a crime of forgery of public documents.
The Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as has been said, and determine the provenance of the apprehended drug.
The detainee, A. A. J. 28, was transferred to police units to conduct the appropriate proceedings and will make it available to him in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of some medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to leave her parking lot in Montecito, as People magazine has been unveiled by a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol.
The witness has detailed that at about 4:30 a.m., Locklear "was stepping on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and as he went backwards he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Soon after, the witness, who apparently hadn't recognized the actress at first, saw locklear stop at a nearby highway and get out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and excess alcohol was discarded from the outing, although "as officials observed at first glance, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested as suspected of driving under the influence of some substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison at about 7 p.m. although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian UI federation to assume its competences in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of training that will have to make a decision on the case of the former Councilor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making favor deals to relatives.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," Llamazares said of the performance that the party will have to adopt with which until now A councillor in the Sevillian consistory.
However, the UI leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities Silva may have committed: "UI has always argued that such matters have the highest degree of transparency."
In the same line he stressed that the training has "strict ethical codes for all public office".
'Blood of May', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in Sangre de Mayo, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of performers.
Blood of May, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, opens this Friday in the cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this film "a childhood dream", which should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2 madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set with the decorations and the appropriate costumes the portrait of "a stunned Spain that was wrong to fight for, since, the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Ferdinand VII" , he's aimed.
But the filmmaker regrets not having been funded like Alatriste's or Goya's Ghosts - more than double that of Blood may - so he has not been able to shoot some scenes embodied in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
For this reason, the director of Re-start has influenced what is his usual way of working, staging with the actors, with which he usually rehearses before starting filming and who does not do casting, because he finds himself "humiliating" and consider that "part of the director's office lies in going to the theater and film to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters with which he coincides in Sangre de Mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
An Oscar candidate four times - of which he won one - Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood, the May Blood itself, Seven French Billiard Tables and the finally selected one, The Blind Sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that should be made known" , you have assured.
With this film Garci doesn't expect prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you settle for making one more film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay homage to a dancer also Sevillian.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, a Catalan father and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free women's movement.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in the Europe of between wars fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I found it amazing."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell her life but to collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks to me.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I've been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," she says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one in her shows, as she did in the "The Open Door"; and with teacher Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever her student was.
"Matilde makes Tortola a major, the character of maturity.
I am happy that I have agreed to act in my work and I am very honored by it."
The montage also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of such artists who were divas to their full extent, and who are always in love with them".
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in places as far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, since she habitually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she's one of those women who has a huge influence at a certain time and now nobody knows, let alone values her work," Bayon says.
The show will begin today at 8:30 a.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
J. Vicente Resino at Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
They called me attention for their simplicity and by the force they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
The publication of the "Diary of a Newlywed Poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Newly Opened Poet" at Saint Stephen's Church , New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, it is part of the activities programmed by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized with the purpose of commemorating the fifty anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Triennium Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-editing of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of the Nobel and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which , after traveling through the various Andalusian provinces, it is planned to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
Likes, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of Malice," and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of the entire America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look how hard it was for them to give him an Oscar.
And that he had been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very ill.
It's still been a sledgehammer for everyone.
"Sometimes what you feel is beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend," mourned Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of their existence."
No one was afraid to make a fool of themselves or exaggerate.
A father of film and homeland had died at a particularly dark time, afraid of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking motives for dignity.
When so hard time is and without virtue men and well few beings to admire you, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for all an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and advocate of lost and won causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his firstborn overdose-dead to his brand of home-cooked and organic food.
A gift to a country that has had a hard time overcoming a suicidal food culture.
The shockwave of Hollywood barry admiration without catering to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, noted that not a man died but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was no more or less than the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"It has left the bar very high for all of us," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping the demand for probity high and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This isn't always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but was then married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to which he was faithful when he probably had plenty of opportunities not to be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger outside the house, if inside I have steak?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters match his fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none of them were as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, solicitous grandfather, and dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that an Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failure of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect career was called, and in my opinion it was the worst race I've ever been in.
A waste of waste that, of course, if you took it into account as an evaluation and I examined, would be a very clear suspense.
But let's go in parts and from the beginning.
The depropositos start with the collection of the bib, which makes you have to go first.
Which doesn't seem bad to me, but if they already make you go they give everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Not really.
Here they only made you go to pick up the bib number (first devoid, go just for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the T-shirt (second devoid, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Or have they decided to buy only small T-shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper ones because of the crisis?
Well, things like this are a minucia compared to those of race day.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and you also have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes lasted the wait, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, unsurprisingly, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the pickup was worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was joined by conatos of popular rebellion and assault on the shed.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me won't even show up with the right time in the rankings, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, didn't mark my way out properly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect career, it wouldn't come into my thoughts.
So I think we'll continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft searches for receptionist (virtual)
At MIT's Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft has shown a preview of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company's campus) attending to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not a company employee.
He asks if he's there to visit someone and tells him he'll be with you shortly.
All without blue screening.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week there has been talk well above a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won't have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of loaded with commercial basurilla, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it'll be for less.
A finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome went out on the net, I was one of those who added to the theory that it was Google's first step in competing with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for hardware and software to be understood.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never go away but you have to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half the applications that come in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and is finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I have a small example.
I took the photo of this post in one of Microsoft's employee break rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
On the soda machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not arrive in early 2009 but in late, rather by pulling in 2010.
At Microsoft they will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to take its bill.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the French Coast, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start listing stellar apparitions, we can go back to the image of that strong pointed moustache who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
In essence, it's just the typical men's underwear t-shirt in cotton, tight and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the speaking Anglos call, but le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles points out above all the others.
First, by its bombastic name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with sport because it is named, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out from the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most emblematic T-shirt models wear as detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sea shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for underwear comfort.
It's a shame to leave them as underwear, though.
They have too much charm.
Second round for Honda's bestseller
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new minivan has an even wider interior space.
To all this are added refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
That's the second generation Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model it should be commented that this new Jazz arrives six years after the first generation was introduced to the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter timeframe than that employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less well known, in other markets this model is a phenomenon of sales.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during 2008.
About one million Jazz units have been sold in Japan since its launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda aims to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 jazz units, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a 17% growth in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand leaders expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, representing 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a 16% drop.
Despite this increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda relies on the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a hybrid of five doors and compact size - 4.37 meters in length - of which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By market and according to Japanese manufacturer estimates, 50% of Insight sales will occur in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be split between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is planned for the first months of the year, once its presentation in partnership is made in January in Valencia.
Regarding the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its dimensions.
Its length amounts to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase to 2.50 meters, an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and is maintained at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - amounts to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measurements are from the version with the 1.4 engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility to mount the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines are also new in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will have two petrol thrusters of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre mechanic gets a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 laps.
This propeller - which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has an expense of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With regard to the previous propellant, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, it now becomes 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horsepower achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Today the Cruz sisters take their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful, famous girls who lend their name.
He has been to Paris in the promotion that the firm Mango makes in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, she wins in the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have devised for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense but at the same time exciting day.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love 1950s and 1960s cinema; that's where we get a lot of references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch the women as they dress, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything come together and they have a lot of ties in common.
I liked clothes from a young time; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to dig into my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to watch the way I dressed.
You know that dancers really like to do our styling for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when you get the costumes is when you really find the character.
So, everything is united, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You haven't been in your 30s long ago, have you had a crisis?
What's going on.
I feel better than ever, I like all 30.
I find that women are made, have experience and savor life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a kid, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body asks me to do it, and besides, I want to be a young mom; I don't want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with great love.
As for the cinema, you're watching for several premieres you shot last year.
That's right, and I can't wait for them to see the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, everything I want for now and of course, can not be.
I want 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of Christ's Tomb' to be eded.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you debuted on a catwalk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I got on a catwalk to model.
She simply called me Naomi Campbell, which I've known for a long time, to invite me to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we exhibited - I took two pieces out of our collection for Mango - it was auctioned off to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
There are so many things said about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm left with that good part she gets involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he ever asked me to make the pine, then also.
For benefiting third-world women, whatever it takes.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of Nissan accident prevention technologies, it has been inspired, this time, by nature, in particular, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan's four-area Security Shield.
This robot intends to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand's vehicles.
During its flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that looks a lot like the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of the bee, able to see with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing you to fly without interruption within your own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles up to two metres away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object, and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately results in collision prevention.
"The moment you detect an obstacle, the small robot will mimic a bee's movements and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at right or greater angles to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is completely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and principal engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be deflected up or down, or diagonally; You can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allow you to turn your wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, as well as acceleration and deceleration, for the small robot to avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It doesn't require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with just a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, not even megas."
This is the first step in developing new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced to standard cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the lithium-ion variety.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to their destination avoiding obstacles along the way.
Drivers who repeat alcoholaemia must install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcohol, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the vehicle drunk, or if it is not blown.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the State Attorney General's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver, so the driver will also receive a road re-education course.
In the experience, in addition to the Attorney General of Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety Foundation (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving catch the car again.
The alcolock would avoid this as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in breathed air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow abtes; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study carried out in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure is in the face of administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such behaviour before they result in criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done ordinaryly, and yet the reform necessary by criminal means requires reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although it has already been experimentally implemented in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on a PSOE initiative in which it intends to install this system on school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without peep-toes
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the scheduled time in the program landed in the presidential Hangar of Benito Juarez airport in Mexico City the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced the hand to be used as a visor to see the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, then you will not be able to go to the airport to charge at that time... She's from here or so...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish but she lived here a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many wait in the airport hangar stuck to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 Marine soldiers who play the salvo of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, mane in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual peep-toes, perhaps she had been informed that in the DF she was threatening storm.
They give a smile and a short stop to the photographers before moving to the room where the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four greats of the city, a reporter from Mexican television awaits you.
Tiemble before foreclosure
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make injections, is not devoid of ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a pleasant and informative browser game: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is, the 'Hotel of bad credits'... or the trouble.
The tetric aspect of this accommodation and especially your receptionist is to think about once, twice and up to three times if it's time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably its goal.
True, it has useful, but untailed, information.
It's more of a teen page than a place for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
Well, a dream room appears inside the hotel.
Something is something, because buying a better house we don't even talk about...
The best-endowed award in fashion
There may be no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, that Paris and there may not be a more exquisite living designer and bont live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of The Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in mango's showcase at number 54 of Paris Boulevard Haussmann and almost cried with emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one's in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank designer Valentino for presiding over the jury of the contest, caused us to end up at a fancy dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with a broken heart of sorrow and making heart guts, by the recent death of his brother, put on a suit of the House and some ELAH dressings, which cut off his breath, and his son Louis' arm - a canyon almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his homage dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is such a gentleman that he ended up, next to the Baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because he had both lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the shop in trousers and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner was transformed into a long black sexy dress, she was thrilled when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were shown the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made an amago of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for a walk through the palace outbuildings, but first showed us on his mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we were able to brighten our eyes with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canyon that travels by motorbike - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously ordered, that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la, c'est la vie.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1000 but 1000 plus a way to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And if that's not all, they're all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it's even worse to imagine yourself involved in the hectic pace imposed by today's life.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection with the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together on the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach bookstores with Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to achieve peace of mind in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean these who wake up very smart telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk in their sleep.
The first time it happens, you might get a scare, but it doesn't really matter.
Sleep disturbance is a benign sleep disturbance called somniloquis.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of them have been told he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in a lifetime for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once in meseS...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its occurrence.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (peeing asleep) or sleepwalking, but it doesn't have to be.
As mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever conditions, stress or overexcitement situations.
It's a little-studied phenomenon anyway.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
You may speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there are any issues that are generating a lot of anxiety and gives him exit in this way.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disturbance that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children who have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will help the child to have a quieter sleep.
Once the somniloquias appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not conscious, and you'll break his sleep.
Even if he's talking, he's sleeping and therefore he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes, you may want to consult or find out what generates so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he's saying (which isn't the most common thing), don't be tempted to do an interrogation to snout information.
You will get nothing, because being asleep is not conscious enough to organize his thinking.
You will also hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming of to say that, so be very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
That creates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's not bad at all, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory in their field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having made a good match, the team created many goal chances and was able to score a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very constant during this encounter in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who grazed the squadron with a shot from afar, Illhaeusern quasi was going to take the "power" and turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn up, Romain with the toe or also Diebold coming to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front of us, we wouldn't let the midfielder through and leave only Riahi in attack.
The beginning of the second half was crucial, first with two goals from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens with Marais' goal, well placed to pick up the rejected ball in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the goalper Illhousiens will not be able to savor his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the cloakrooms a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not seize the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who backed up a bit to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after a major bluff, the ball passed very close to the cross-country.
Sarkozy finds fishermen furious
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will go around Brittany.
Faced with the manifestation of resistance on the part of the fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistére, to find his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and expect him to "come up with concrete propositions."
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen to achieve measures in the face of rising diesel prices, which sets a record by reaching 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elyseo spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors."
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on a firm footing.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to slow traffic in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon has also been blocked, but the connections to Belle-Ele have not been stopped.
"A filter barrier" has been laid on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday burning, scratching the dawn, tyres and wooden paddles in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English coast, such as Les Sables d'Olonne in Vandea, where the Bous stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of trade ships.
Fishermen from La Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantic region stopped the blockade of the major Total Donges refinery in the afternoon.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until this Wednesday's meeting that the ministry will take place to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by national fisheries committee leaders, who did not maintain their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen did not abandon" and "do not want to move towards Paris," said Liliane Cariou, the chairman of Lorient's fisheries committee, for example.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay diesel fees, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial equilibrium point of a boat can be reached only with a diesel priced less than 0.30 euro per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of "Two Men and a Destiny" has died of cancer, at age 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who has died at age 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
Brazil's aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite recession threats in the global economy.
The world's fourth-largest aeronautical builder, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, Embraer President Fredrico Fleury Curado said.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian builder relies a lot on the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would aim to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurer, which has been taken out of trouble thanks to the US monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to Sunday's edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, this newspaper states.
AIG's board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to discuss eventual sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of the AIG quales are intended to be separated include their air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., their 59% stake in transatlantic Holdings as well as their real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times pursues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing the US authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with due share among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic Paris Stock Exchange session
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plane to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen on the stock exchange of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most significant drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded last September 17, 2001, that is, the day when exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq index, a technology dominant, fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the widened (extended) Standard & Poor's 500 index by 8.81% (or 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis earlier in session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plane to save the banks that would have allowed some market stability to be regained.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, representatives denied US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he was asking for.
About two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"That's not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows the extent to which the market had this plan," Lindsey Piegza added, fearing that a project adopted within several days will come "too late."
" If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the US central bank, the Network No.) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions more," said Brian Bethune, Head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every passing day the fall of a financial institution is announced" in the United States, Ms Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by their rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing "not just a crisis in the US but a global crisis," FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market rose dramatically.
The yield on the 10-year treasury bond fell by 3.632%, up from 3.827% on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4.161%, up from 4.357% on the eve.
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, to disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news story that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its listing.
A week after discovering a provisional settlement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common stock at a unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure you a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall operation would be carried out on the basis of a price per unit of measure of $29, or 28% above its current change.
The Morgan Stanley stock lost 6.79% to $23.07 each at 5 p.m. GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," explained Juan Mack, the CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been amended over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for nearly $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the CEO of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, "we thought the stake would have been made up of only ordinary shares.
But given the current state of the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below its book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares within one year if they are sold more than 50% above the conversion price, or $47 or so, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital contributed by MUFG will allow you to take investment opportunities, strengthen your balance sheet and increase your liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group nonetheless refused to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had greatly eased his balance sheet since late August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, who saw their stock market listing fall in half while the cost of security against a risk of debt defects took off.
This cost fell back last Monday but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of wall street's big investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Recast the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, in the example of his colleagues and friends, he is the third to put to the vote a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission completed as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results of 80% of votes.
According to these results, "no" got 28%, 7% of votes were null votes and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the vote plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted outside polling stations and a recount by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad "yes" victory, estimated between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday night to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed in a crushing way", he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who head the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south-west of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will be held in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
The draft Constitution involves increasing the power of the state over the economy, reserving the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially through oil extraction by foreign companies and thanks to foreign exchange sent by its emigrations.
Carried by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the head of state, who will be able to do up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and intend a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of the gratuitous health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for the interdiction of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
At Friday's first debate between the two White House candidates, another one happened to find out who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Without surprise, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while honorable, was not "bright enough" to allow him to stem his drop in the five-week polls of the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday awards five points of advantage to Obama (49% vs. 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who went well.
Among the undecided voters, who count, Obama won 39% of respondents, while 25% of them concede victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his member of his own candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts, " warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Septuageny McCain highlighted his undisputed foreign policy experience, underlining his adversary's "naivety" about these issues that were at the heart of this first misdeed.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... He accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican televised advertising.
Obama stressed that it represented the future.
Without being bewildered, he was concise and precise.
He enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore America's image to the world.
"McCain hasn't yet understood, while Obama has already done so," he retorted, this weekend, a Democratic television commercial that reproached the Republican for failing to consider the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans."
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a reluctant rain.
He did not utter the words "middle class" or "workers." "Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is regarded by Americans as the most capable character in saving the economy on the edge of the cliff.
"Next week could be a decisive episode," chief executive Charles Schumer said yesterday.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic nominee, the current funding disaster " is the final eight-year consequence of a bad economic policy put in place by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that it would nevertheless come to reduce taxes of 95% of Americans despite the starts of Wall Street, the Illinois senator also noted that the realization of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a health and safety system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, both candidates dodged the issues that concerned the $700 billion (470 billion euro) financial rescue plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, "Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislatures.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon since the closure of polling stations in Minsk's central square to protest against the fraudulent nature of legislative ones.
While no results had yet been announced, many young men had come to speak out against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "The dictator, he has to resign."
Some acknowledge not having voted: "For what, as they will do what they want with my vote," says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that brought foreign observers a good face in order to renew contact with the European Union is ready to make democratic change.
Sanctions, including visa interdiction for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
They weren't according to the opposition.
"We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of votes," lamented Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Democratic Forces Union, a heterogeneous reunification of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," stresses Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate of opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, is the executive branch.
If some opposition Members enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
"But his entry into parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and bills."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, goes into crisis, and if we don't reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognise the validity of the vote.
It stresses that participation figures appear too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) favoured manipulation.
"Have you noticed the election? Question social democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition to parliament, the ones who best suit the power. "
The silence of the night returns again in the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the central electoral commission welcome his success.
The 19 abducted people have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the raptors of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions abducted ten days ago in the desert arrived unhinged in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good upon arrival at 15H30 aboard a special aircraft to Al Maza Military Base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical testing, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana declared at the airport.
On 19 September these hostages fell into the possession of 35 unknown hijackers while enjoying an off-road safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the confines of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since passed from one zulo to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the organization of the safari.
An Egyptian security official indicated that 30 special forces members, transported aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight before dawn.
"One exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled," said this manager who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "flash" unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"It must be acknowledged that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in the secret services, of the special forces," he said without going into detail.
He also demined the payment of a ransom.
On the eve of the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an SUV aboard which were the kidnappers, of whom it killed six, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also stated that they were related to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), an assertion immediately demented by this group.
Lyrics - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of the fait les manchettes culture and occupies the current election campaign.
It's better this way.
But a section of our cultural life remains forever forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or starving national historical sites?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don't we have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage like in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to restore only Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that heritage protection is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all of this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec History Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped into 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving piles of private archives with little money, and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the guard dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and managers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
By when, a monument for history and heritage?
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec yesterday celebrated its 10th anniversary of its founding, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again been one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained the public's trust that had seriously been wavered by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer be reproduced.
While Judge Krever was slow to present his relationship, certain provinces then set up a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, nearly 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Décary recalls.
The situation was daunting.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence," he says, proudly, saying that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population subsequently had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that "trust is extremely fragile."
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were attending in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Décary tells.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know and when a serious illness can emanate from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we put in place exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so the precautionary principle that was applied made sense. "
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleide acid tests that allow direct detection in the donors' blood of the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
Nucleide tests shortened the period between when the person has been infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We were able to reduce this period by less than one week.
We thus substantially reduce the risk that certain donors will unknowingly be infected and that we will not be able to detect them.
These improvements significantly lowered the risk of getting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Thus, since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product comes.
I believe that a blood transfusion can be received or prescribed today to regain health without worries," says the head of TheMa-Quebec management.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, in the example of the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," dr. Décary pursues before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for sufficient supply.
"Needs increase because the population ages.
Since anti-carcinogenic treatments are more aggressive, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
An ageing population also has consequences on the network of blood donors that groups on average only 3% of Quebequeses eligible for blood donation. "
All people in good health, 18 years of age and who correspond to the eligibility criteria can nevertheless donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Hardships are very rare.
But members of this donor network need to be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to hold them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since today's life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating her blood," quenches Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart leaflets, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, putting on the bench our thousandth blood sample of the umbilical cord and it is expected to draw more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood-taking program as very popular.
"Many moms are disappointed that they can't enjoy this," since Héma-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in every hospital in Quebec.
Softbol - The Impact in the Semi-Finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-finals of the USL's first division playoff series, thanks to a 3–1 (4-3 final) victory at the expense of the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during the second and decisive game of the quarter-final series, at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half with no goal from anywhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goal chances.
Roger Levesque was the only Che to descrat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that during the first game of the round-trip series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2–1 defeat at Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in suburban Seattle.
The Impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-final.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, thunder lost 3-1 in the second game to take him 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless entered the semi-finals 5-4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short – Kovalev's victorious goal
The Canadian's number one trio is ready to start the season.
Alex Kovalev's composite unit, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a Canadian 3-2 win to barrier free throws against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, Tricolor's fourth in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play his best in the first half, Guido Carbonneau scored.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation. "
Charest deals with the North
Prime Minister doesn't exclude elections before end of year
As soon as the liberal Party's general council ends, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Health Minister, Yves Bolduc (left-wing), tries to make himself a choice during today's part-election.
Reject the limits of our last major northern frontier": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength staying on the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
Spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc. paraded on three huge screens.
Great means as during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the election will take place this fall, although he made it clear that his schedule was very full.
The "Northern Plane" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space," which includes an agreement on labor with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe, and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister nevertheless merely explained why the North was "a jewel to immense potential," but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, dominated by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France," "is our home, is in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it's in us," he insisted, as if to show that he was requesting a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the flood to gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it's our future," he added, having taken a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, comprises a portion of the Labrador that Quebec always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
"It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion presents itself, I reiterate that position on the part of the government," he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we must rethly our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the northwest passage, which will open every year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers occupying the territory to be a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebequés de Ungava party), have already started consultations near thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benot Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role to play in some work.
The prime minister does not exclude an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a meeting in which "a common vision will be given."
The development of the North would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan "will be agreed, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new occasions of growth and development."
This was one of the recurring weekend themes, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival in the party's power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Power Station in Adélard-Godbout Reservoir.
"From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made James Bay our party was able to forge the future," juan Charest declared.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North," prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Touching on the theme of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
"This stays among us, but I anticipate being there, " he confided to his militants, arousing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that no elections would take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not miss the possibility of launching a vote this autumn, which the law allows.
He stresses that his schedule is nonetheless full, particularly because of a federation council mission in China and a Quebec-New York York summit.
The weekend general council supplied the liberal chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly "constitutional aspirations" that had no problems to be accepted: the Quebec Liberal Party claims in particular recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wished that Quebec should name members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they should have a veto right over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we embraced the great lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, resigned from implementing it.
If she had, "we would make progress today," Ms Marois said next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Francoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what you want, is that this is not fair a spectacle," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns on vacation today.
Letters - A dishonorable country
It is Mr Vic Toews, former Minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
Thus dishonor this woman who led a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration what she says all about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are recriminate to him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and lets a child-soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who clashes with false justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to enjoy the benefit of a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, certainly forever after so many years of exaction.
We still don't realize that, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy," that's the word Harper continues to repeat that doesn't make sense.
The time has come when no morality exists anymore: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the hither day's minority head of government wants (what happens after October 14?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtue, Law, and Order: they do not see that this government renounced what our country's reputation and dignity did.
Mr. Toews, shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest gold company in the world attempted a six million euro defamation process against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate."
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation prosecutions, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to harm whoever dares to hold a position contrary to theirs?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers held by the miner's almost bottomless pockets.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will gag at the opposition as well as frighten whoever will dare to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several of the countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by blushing.
It was therefore sufficient for the miner to open her books, her files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to trust public opinion and rejects supporting requests and letters for Noir Canada authors.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can ask for a "public" debate by disresezing his views?
According to the vice president, it seems that this word refers only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What he doesn't understand - or what he doesn't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the audience that supports Noir Canada's authors and publishers does so mostly because it rejects the miner's brutal manner.
This audience is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but based on civilized changes in arguments, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a persecution-gag (chasing the "public debate," Barrick Gold has just filed a request regarding Noir Canada's authors by encouraging them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, The Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on university freedom of search and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and argue about subjects who displease rich companies in this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of many persecutions, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by The Authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he does not feel like a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the university world, but also to public debate in Canada, and it is high time that governments put up devices that limit this genre of abusive persecution.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and Congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to stem the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Chambers of Congress.
It particularly foresees: better control by those elected from its implementation, of new mechanisms that seek to ensure the reimbursement of the public money invested, of the new provisions to contain the number of houses seizened the non-payment, as well as a right of control over the wages paid to the leaders of the companies served.
American Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House President Nancy Pelosi and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations lasting two days.
"We make great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current wall street crisis," she explained.
"It's the fundamental point: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos, and disruptions to Americans' daily lives will be immense," Republican Judd Gregg said.
Negotiations had ended very quickly in recent hours because they feared the effect of a further failure on investor humor.
The last hour they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential election, who have joined the negotiations late, were rather in favour of the agreement, not forgetting to squeeze their discontent with being forced to reach this end.
Democratic Sen. Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly that which would allow homeowners to keep their home and the salary of the leaders of the surviving companies by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some, we should not congratulate the ourselves.
But these measures are necessary," he said on American television.
His Republican adversary, John McCain, interrogated in another network to find out if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable."
The $700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money the dubious debts, risky and invincible assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a liquidity freeze and a disbandment of banks and financial institutions.
It's a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft deal last week.
We believe that we have emerged from stagnation since Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of the companies in difficulty are only secured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to clean up the roughness for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision stipulating that if the government had to make losses over five years with this program, it could impose new fees that would aim to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which 100 million more billion can be added if the president thinks it is necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
Instead of his help, Washington will get stakes in the help-succor companies that will be worth dividends in the event of a profit and which it will be able to res sell when the storm will pass.
The federal government will be able to delay the procedures for embargoes on housing obtained from property loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and cash compensation paid to the leaders of companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and to that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, you are still not sure that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest against this project yesterday, both on the part of Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the house finance commission, told his constituents that "with all evidence, Washington doesn't want to understand."
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not the one about taking advantage of taxpayers."
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who is an animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel Laureates, wrote to us to tell each other: we asked Congress not to rush and to carefully examine the way to take," he said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we had again proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
Intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after French bank BNP Paribas reported that it had been waiing to buy its bankruptcy competitor since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) during the risky real estate loan crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regained a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and families will now appreciate that times are uncertain. "
During this time, on the other side of the English, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
Spanish bank Santander unveiled yesterday that it is the one that would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Committed Icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
The American actor with a lovely smile had freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensibility and a talent that was evident will also have taken him away from the record of power that true sacred monsters have.
But what a great runner in the background!
Paul Newman, who died Friday, at 83, from lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fast years.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, whom he looked a lot like and who was long regarded as a rival in film, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outburst of dramatic covenants.
Mixed bloods often make great children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
One of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born from these European roots.
No excessive ego, latest quality mark.
Because it projected an entire country in love with self-made man, the combat-wounded Pacific War fighter, who in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale, then frequented New York's Actor's Studio, before succeeding in theater, television and early film.
This man who qualified for civil rights was also the car driver who qualified second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, dubbed by a sex symbol, although a member of a modeling couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the secret sides of this secret star, discreet and committed, allergic to the scandals of show business that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused the filmmakers to be vertigo this weekend, while his big papers are interted on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual moving defilates through it.
Many memories come to mind as Butch Cassidy's charming cow-boy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Zinc Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoked his sensitive Lord Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not keep all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have moved on to the history of cinema.
This rocky graziano boxer, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, repeated after his death, which he truly cast on Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic mangant in the sumptuous film The Sting, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and avenging pool player in Robert Rossen's magnificent 1961 film The Hustler, he will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar among nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him best thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With one last role as godfather of the Irish Mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curly.
Contrary to several film legends who soon dropped out of the race, Newman stayed long in the world of film, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its annoyances and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, humorously, "as a challenge that lives in "underplaying" and judges his overly supported performances.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to which the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young gallant than marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose features reflected rebellions.
As a filmmaker, Newman revealed sides his true not-well-known pubic sensibility.
Her 1968 film Rachel Rachel (according to Canadian margaret laurence's novel), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the title role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
"Among the many tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very saddened: "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence"
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his career as a legend, there is also a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, an answering against Hollywood excesses.
We will have seen much of his face reign over the jars of vinaigrette sauce, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to its Foundation for Children in difficulty.
Newman, rather than contenting himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on 8 October, criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant harm, in a way of business, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including the forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, they used for their own purposes the funds obtained in public competitions, often justifying the fulfillment of tasks with false invoices.
Public and city council funds - wholly about HUF 65 million - stopped in part in the Treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization and partly in the pocket of individuals.
The method, which was disclosed by the researchers as well, was to justify the collection of the funds obtained in public competitions with false invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the various associations never fulfilled their obligations assumed.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were fake.
To do this they obtained the rotaries in the market of the District of Józsefváros and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
She asked for an invoice for her consumption and these served as a model for making the invoices they submitted among others in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City Council of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András Iri, who according to our information rather wrote the necessary reports to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his "studio trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Pont Egyes-let Biztos Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people do not fit at once in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Foundation - later called Egy-tt a Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill consisted of one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of large fantasy invoices also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in the holding of books of the same - according to the information given to the Public Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb J.
The company's manager Gysz Farkas informed hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and the invoices were shown to him, he already knew that these were false documents.
"On the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems it was also not agreed that according to the invoice a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people fit.
Meals were also included on the bill, while the restaurant has long since not worked.
Enthusiastic invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so the cash payment invoice foolishly indicated a trip within Hungary as a service, which also did not coincide with the agency's invoice issuance practice.
In addition - as was known during the investigation - VAT was also included in the document, even though travel outside the territory of the European Union was tax-exempt.
Among other things, the MEASURE of VAT was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révf.l.p Kft. for the Jobb Foundation, since the services of that undertaking are not loaded with 25 but only 15 per cent VAT, in addition the hotel employees only extended invoices made by machine however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "shippers" made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecution - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Likewise, by formal differences - inadequate invoice format, false stamp - it was learned that invoices issued for Egy-tt to Harmadik -vezredért Alapítvány, for XXI are false. Századi Kulturális Egyes-let and for Biztos Pont.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied issuing those invoices.
Nor did the counterfeiters pay attention that when the Fiatal group Városért Egyes-let ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, that is why the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - refused to issue such a document.
They consciously issued the bills
Another group of manufacturers of fake invoices are those who were aware that they should issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth some four million HUF on behalf of the Egy-tt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the indictment - was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gyerfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
Similarly, zuschlag and his accomplices collaborated with the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately FIVE million HUF to the Jobb J.V.R.R. Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyes-lle Association and the Association V. Egyes-lle, with no real economic activity behind it.
There was no movement of capital either, because then they cancelled the invoices prepared but forgot to record this entity in their documents.
The following group of fake invoice manufacturers include those that have some link to the defendants.
For example Ivan Kubatov was the demander of the Ukrainian manager of the Budapest-based Delta Trio SL, which deald with the fuel and vehicle trade.
The company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to research data these invoices were purchased by Kiskunhalas Cash Investment Kft., which since 14 September 2005 has been under liquidation.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Egytt to Harmadik'vezredért Alapítvány charging the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually functioned because - according to the defendant - they received no work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generáció.
Kubatov, on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, gave a total of 15 invoices to various entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Public Prosecutor's Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the invoice amount.
This man even took advantage of comandita Szi-Beri's society to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They won 500 thousand HUFs respectively from the contest, but did not use the money for the objectives of the contest.
To ensure that this is not discovered, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft were submitted to the TMA.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Arpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will likely recount at the trial - as they did in the Prosecution Service - the course of falsifying the invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main defendant János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, he has not done so until now.
The question is: what is the interest of doing so, for perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the Socialists reached an agreement with him for Zusi to assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days may even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he applied for house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the many perpetrators of far superior economic crimes, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for sentencing, he has no chance for that.
Overlapping Psychology: Why do we spend more money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
New York University neurologists and economists discovered the neurological - economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study in the journal Science, people don't want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists attempted to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in an auction and in the meantime the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment were examined using the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI).
In both games participants could make money, but during the auctions, where it is essential to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-prize" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention so as not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, economists in the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against a person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive an additional $15 prize.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in the event of losing the auction, the group members lost even that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the neurologists' hypothesis, members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
For those until now explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped solve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation" - established Andrew Schotter, professor of the faculty of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When should I go to the doctor?
Around five hundred million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
It is estimated at one hundred thousand the number of infected in this country, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms look a lot alike; Liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but its pathogens and diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are spread in two main forms: hepatitis A and E foodbornely (e.g. with water or food spread), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body moods (sperm, vagina mood, saliva).
Travellers are recommended to protect themselves by vaccine against virus A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested by poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this appear on the skin and on the white of the eyes jaundice, the excrement becomes light, the urine dark color and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year one million people die worldwide in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most severe forms of hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected receives drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Therefore it is very important premature recognition, systematic medical control.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users, and those with tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people worldwide with chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory monitoring as well, it is worth consulting with your family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease is cured if discovered early, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so that contagion can be suppressed and cancer prevented.
30 September is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
It aims to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of premature recognition.
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of fortis Bank.
The States of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis which is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis in the North American market: the three countries will support this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's economic competition manager.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the Euro area crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has occurred in several waves more than a year ago, so decisions taken with respect to the Bank can in some ways be seen as precedents.
According to sunday's early-morning decision, the three states will purchase approximately half (49%) of the Bank's property in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a portion of its businesses, including, above all, activities - mainly insurance - purchased last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis' actions began a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees this bank is too big to allow it to break.
The company's shares on Friday alone decreased by 12 percent, this being the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of stocks has declined by more than two-thirds.
Looking at the current share prices, the total value of the group's capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The Bank's management imposed the sharp fall in Fortis shares on the insecurities of the US market in relation to the approval of the $700 billion US package plan.
On Monday the stocks already showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank's new CEO.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors didn't have to worry, they're not going to lose their money.
Among the Bank's clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the banking offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Does it hurt less to those who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviated the death of Catholicism's martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious belief influences human pain - the British telegraph newspaper reported.
As part of this unique experiment, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were being electric shocked, while everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first in the series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University also participate.
The analysis occurred as follows; they attached a sparkling instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the experiment participants to look at two paintings; to the Virgin Mary, the work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and the Lady of leonardo da Vinci's ermine of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious spirit among the faithful, as they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while observing religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics claimed that as they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "calmed down and peace reigned in their hearts."
Looking at the religious theme chart, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so shocking you can achieve such an effect with the atheists as well, you only have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person they feel very positively about, like a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really changes our personality," Wright added.
After these formidable results, there is only one question: what effect would it have on pain regulation if the faithful were shown Leonardo's Madonna or another painter of his size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On his tenth birthday Google can say: you can find him both in people's pockets and in the sky above his head; knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit, and what they're interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who parallel the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to gather as much personal data about its users as possible, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original objectives of Google's founders: "We gather in one system all the information in the world!"
According to Google's leader, the company even after ten years of work that stirred the world is still in the early stages of the effort to be able to process all the information.
To the question that what is going to happen in five years Schmidt replied like this: I would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would suit me best?" - however, the software will not be able to answer seemingly so simple questions as long as there is not enough information from users.
Not all internet users are aware that during their browsing on the Network, the searched keywords, IP addresses and the pages where they passed at the end of the search are precisely stored.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-consult what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic will be based the Recommendations, on which the system will offer products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who care seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear for punishment, yearning for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that they not only retain, but in justifiable cases also yield to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify paedophiles.
By contrast, internet users who care about people's rights in May were relieved when the company along with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated in court that it was right in its litigation with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google cannot be forced, through any of the points of the constitution, to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government succeeded in enlisting the child protection law passed years ago, nearly fifty thousand Web addresses and about a thousand searched phrases, but without obtaining search lists from individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the past two months.)
This is quite contradictory to the opinion on Google: it is criticized by those who fear providing their personal data because they think their privacy is harmed, their private lives when they start using Google's services, and they rebel against it as against multinational conservative companies.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, internet users and users from other countries see in them the future generation, the "state-of-the-art corporation", not so to its rival, Microsoft, listed by its Windows as conqueror of the world, however much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the program package free, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks see precisely the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that was produced precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and leveraging the available communication channels, and as their measurements vary individually, the essence remains the same: show ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music customs, then they can be included in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, which automatically lists the latest photo galleries that are stored on Flickr or Picasa.
We can learn numerous cases from which it is clear that for example the bride, seeing the flow of photographs the next morning of the common friends, finds out who she spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or can fire the employee of a company because she writes her honest opinion on her blog about the direction of the company : one thing is certain, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person's "online" life is what she shows of herself - this is the definition behind the youth behavior of our day.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least pretends to dodge Google's monopoly, can do so (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but leaves no traces).
There are many people who don't want to sign up for collective pages to prevent them from being found, but google's online apps can be replaced, from text writing software to image and news reading apps with alternative versions that don't connect to gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion almost hopes that openly the day google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten advertising agency revenue, while increasingly fast-introducing services cause severe headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will find the alarming contradictions too: for example senior management flatly rejected employee protest after doubling the price of the company's childcare, they considered the unlimited number of employees' food too expensive, but all of this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google yielded to pressure from the Chinese government and the company under the agreement leaked all information violate the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says they won't announce any new services in advance, but only when it's ready to go, which if it's certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to stir the world: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and file project will take on such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the U.S. Supreme Court , others fear your Health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database will be able to provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, novel by Cory Doctorow's popular, orwelianly describes that future, in which a man only from Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the traces of the perpetrator of the double murder of the city of 'zd.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of ozd who, on a well-founded suspicion, helped erase the traces of the crime - the spokesman for borsod province's Public Order General Police Station said Tuesday.
The young women acknowledged the crime that was charged to them, and are currently accused of fautors of the crime.
The two minors - according to the information of the Hungarian News Agency, these are two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The defendant in the double murder of 'zd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is charged with murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday of last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of a company in 'zd, where he killed him and then also killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI reports, the young man prepared much earlier to perpetrate the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the scene of the crime.
Police analyze the weapon and the circumstances of its use with an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech kroner - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, even though the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 per cent of the shares are held by the Polish state, which in a few months wants to sell 60 per cent of them.
Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the polish offer has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, they have so far offered the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the Stock Exchange in New York, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Borse.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, declared last week that among those interested the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not ruled out the possibility that the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear in the future.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion kronor.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90% of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25%, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their Comments on Tuesday devoted to the ever-deeper international financial crisis speak of a "second 9/11."
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - the Republic of Rome believes - the president has not even been able to get his own party's support for the hastily made bill, the aim of which is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor," which billionaire investor Warren Buffett was talking about, it's more correct to talk about a "second September 11."
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo's view, it was the error of America's political leadership that brought the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing, and this will then reverberate around the world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after congressional voting, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
This threat cannot be ignored - the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva points out.
Some states today can still throw lifeguard belts at wobbly financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if, as the dominoes fall apart even more bank, then neither the new funds will be enough, nor will the new improvisations.
It is needed in the long term for the member states of the European Union to put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone - Viennese Der Standard recalls, adding that concerns are becoming increasingly real that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not dealt seriously with the crisis that passes as a cuname through the Old Continent.
"Saviors" won't have to immediately submit hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid a greater evil?
Smart car mimics bumblebee flight
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of obstacle sensors existing in nature?
For example, that of bumblebees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, bumblebees provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic car steering system type BR23C imitator of nature, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, Chief Technology Director of RP and Development and Research.
The compound eyes of bumblebees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees play an important role.
To copy the composite eye function, engineers used the laser length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance, and sends a signal to the vehicle's microprocessor that immediately transforms into a maneuver to prevent collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot mimicking the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by turning the wheels to the extent necessary.
Unlike any existing system today, this maneuver is completely instinctive.
"If not, the vehicle robot couldn't react quickly enough to dodge obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Lab and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process should be done in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonal, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotating movement and acceleration in addition to the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and their energy density is higher, which means they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the processing capacity of the data, let alone the storage.
This device in every second should only process some input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with instinctive logic based on the data from previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No gigabyte or megabyte memory is required.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately dodge obstacles, which according to Nissan calculations, within ten years can be incorporated into mass-produced models.
Another possibility for your application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to their destination, dodging the obstacles existing in their path.
This expensive child already has a name.
The written version of the $700 billion financial rescue package law has been prepared and will be implemented in several phases in order to purchase bad banks' credits.
Half the money will be spent in the first phase.
According to Eastern Coast schedule during new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the $700 billion bailout package in total, after several days of discussion - the Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the American Congress, stating that the agreement is only to be formalized in a document.
The commitment made to the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the compromise said: this programme will work and be efficient but further action is needed. According to Pelosi, it's not about saving Wall Street, it's about turning the economy car around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington's schedule (i.e. before two o'clock on Monday morning, according to Central European schedule), without causing a spectacular jump in the bags.
On the bill called the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, the U.S. Congress will vote on Monday first and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated news about the deal.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the White House spokesman.
The program is different from the Bush administration's original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy poor-quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy low-rated, credit fund securities, and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
This program will be controlled by a special body, which will also involve the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion can be spent after a new congressional decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactic: it may simultaneously purchase bad loans, mortgages and securities from the credit fund, as well as other "poisonous" credits as well.
The purchase can be made at auctions or directly - competent people from the ministry reported.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the elements of concern, for which companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said: the law so secures the necessary financial means, that even $700 billion can reach even $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the AMERICAN financial system, be it about buying bad financial means, seining it, or preventing risks that could lead to the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything we can to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it," he added.
Instead, the heads of the struggling banks awaiting state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which American slang simply calls a golden parachute.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and limitations depend on the form of aid of the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the context of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on the golden parachutes, unless the bank's failed boss retires.
By directly purchasing bad credits, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that boss compensation is not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations relate only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in American history that a legal limitation on CEO revenue will be in effect - said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Congressional Commission, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in short they will even be able to make a profit from the transaction as soon as the economy recovers and with it the bank.
According to the bill over the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return financial sector losses to taxpayers.
Of course on both sides there were those who expressed reservations regarding the project.
This is not what We were entrusted to us by American citizens, that is, taxpayer dollars are not being protected - California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa said.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: the measures were urged by the same measures that are responsible for the crumbling of The Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1% compared to last month's prices and 12.9% compared to August 2007 prices - the Central Bureau of Statistics (KSH) reported.
Industrial export prices rose by 1.1% compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9% compared to the previous year.
And as a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7% compared to the previous month and 3.2% from the previous year.
Industrial sales prices increased by only a minimum, at 0.1%.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry sectors increased minimally, by 0.1% compared to July.
The biggest increase in price magnitude occurred in August 2008, in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 per cent), mainly due to a 4.6 per cent monthly increase in bags and belts and a 2.5 per cent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the industry's prices of chemical materials (1.6%).
There was a price decline in the petrochemical sector , (1.4 per cent), in the production of electrical machines and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 per cent).
They did not change the prices of paper manufacturing, publishing and printing.
In the other sectors of the processing industry, prices increased by between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent a significant weight within domestic trade, an increase of 0.3% was recorded in August, firstly as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from the first of July.
In a twelve-month comparison - in domestic sales in the processing industry sectors - the largest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4%).
In the metal processing sector, an increase of 13.2% was observed, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, of decisive weight, there was an increase of 11%.
Prices were lowered in the textile industry (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machines and instruments (0.3 per cent).
In all other processing sectors, the pace of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Over the past year in the global processing industry, prices increased by 10.2%.
Prices for electricity, gas, heat and water supplies exceeded previous year's prices by 18.7 percent.
In August, among the different sectors of domestic trade the largest monthly price increase (0.7%) was recorded in the investment goods sectors.

In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest price increase occurred in the energy sectors and in the intermediary industry (16.8%).
Consumer goods-producing industries declined by 6.8 per cent and investment goods by 1.4 per cent.
Industry export prices calculated in HUF increased by 1.1% compared to the previous month, and compared to 12 months, there was a decrease of 3.9%.
The price of our national currency in one month fell by 1.7% against the euro and by 7.1% against the dollar, compared to August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and 15.9% against the dollar.
Will a visa no longer be required next year to go to the United States?
Kinga Goncz believes that there is a good chance that around 12 January the North American-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into force - the foreign minister spoke of it in Chicago, to the Hungarians residing there.
In his view, "virtually everything depends on the electronic access and control system being built on time on the other side of the Atlantic."
At the same time he warned that the entry premiss will disappear in the new system, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin must register.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing over the Middle Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with international policy advisers from presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks' bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates for the two major U.S. parties, on Sunday secured their support for the administration's $700 million banking aid program, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, following several marathon-style negotiations in the early hours of Sunday, announced: a principled agreement was reached on the banks' financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and thawing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to prove that they are more capable than their rival to pull the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, when economic issues were put in the foreground, Obama again gained some advantage and the McCain advantage he had gained after the Republicans' convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy for vice presidential.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the proposal included those consumer protection points, which he supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) employment, savings from you as well as entire industries and the stability of the entire economy is at risk" - he said to a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to describe McCain's economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain explained that "we will all barely swallow this (...) but doing nothing is simply not a viable path."
The Republican senator said the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission for the minister of finesza and the limitation of executive compensation, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain played no important role in the consultations, instead he consulted daily with the minister.
Congressional President Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that congressmen will likely vote on Monday on the bill.
German-speaking press magazine
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscious voters became - says Der Spiegel about the CSU's weak electoral outcome in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a reddish coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Devours His Parents" he discusses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, CSU erosion had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had taken office.
The Social Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Sunday a process was completed that had been envisaged for almost ten years: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU gained 47.7 per cent, for the first time below 50 per cent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during stoiber's much-mentioned era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists 40 years ago have been forecasting this, but in rhythm they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of education and the settlement of North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had negative consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization also increases possibilities and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscious, most critical and stubborn voters became.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it was the conventional groups of citizens who moved further away from the CSU; freelancers, small industrialists, those with high schools and graduates.
This re-referred to less than 40 per cent support for CSU.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
Vienna's Conservative Diary: "Who with whom? In his article entitled "Party presidents are very secretive on coalition issues" - he deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SP wants to negotiate with theVP.
TheVP prohibits the SP from meddled in its internal affairs.
The BZ is open in all directions to negotiate, the Greens do not yet wish to consult on the coalition.
Elections have already been held, now it's all about the coalition; in the debate on public television, party leaders barely let go of some of their decks.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SP, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with theVP.
The SP wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question pending that if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of theVP, in the post of vice-chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the era of Schsssel-Molterer.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said cooperation would surely not be successful if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of theVP.
It is still open in the party if they will elect the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues should certainly be discussed, within the AVP itself.
The president of the BZ, J. Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government," Haider said.
Khark ka: We must break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also president of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that hit Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevailing foundation of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and By Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
Representatives of Governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights organizations attended the meeting.
Khark ka - according to the press bureau of the Fidesz group of Members in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are left out of the labour market first because of their low level of schooling.
"Most young Roma have not completed middle school and due to poor quality of basic education, only an insignificant part can obtain a university diploma."
Járóka further emphasized that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a decisive role in the prevailing foundation of other human rights as well.
Investment in the teaching of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these issues among both Roma and non-Roma.
For the earlier a Roma student starts school, the more likely he is to become an active member of the labor market; through income and consumption taxes, they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate school de-segregation processes, for this it is of fundamental importance to comply correctly with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," Khark ka.
The objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized annually since last year's Berlin meeting in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level of the Member States.
Fox in the chicken coop
In the United States, life and health insurance companies, when viewing drug purchase data, often deny signing an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will be made uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which to the use of prescription data in all cases brings it together with the approval of the given person.
It must be in separate hands, because if not, "we entrust the chicken coop to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the insurance price and compensation amount dependent on the customer's health status and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Previously they sent the client to medical control and signed with him the contract knowing already the result of the control.
Dick ten years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: with the customer identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself concludes on the diseases and health status of the client.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that the level of fat in your blood is virtually incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even set a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to management has little to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some medications are multipurpose, for example certain substances serve both to treat headache, heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the former are not.
Special companies were formed to consult and process this data, which before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
The authorities are already forcing them to do so, although they were not fined for negligence so far.
Some companies have recently also produced the results of laboratory tests and by joining them with drug consumption data, they get more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is becoming increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those that provide health services.
The bill providing the right to the authority for the control of specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his program, which will require the person's specific approval for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another issue that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, however, are exposed to the goodwill of the fox.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be made at the end of October on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off on the tops of the Bavarian CSU, so far the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party president, and provincial prime minister Gonther Beckstein still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long grace will last.
The duo's fate, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party's extraordinary congress last weekend in October.
The members of the much-criticized duo let it be known: they don't hold on to their positions that much.
This was intended to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and their base organization, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - albeit under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was at the peak of his career - the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the crowded coup against Stoiber, they got only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had a "monopoly" in Bavaria, which gives 18% of German GDP.
Although in the southern province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, in the future they will certainly have to coalition with someone.
As a first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, federal minister of agriculture, one of Huber's possible successors, also holds a position in the small intelligence group that starts negotiations with the liberal FDP and with the right-wing Free Voters on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that on the free voters list comes into parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was used for the coup of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly erased the ambitious local politics from the stage.
The top CSU leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition he will receive an active role Stoiber also that until now has been moving the ropes in the background, the former head of provincial government and former president of the CSU rated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel he he he sees it as well.
After the Bundestag's September 2009 elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are unable to enhance together the CSU that played a momentous role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide his disappointment at failure, the CSU's losses will not have a negative impact on Berlin's grand coalition.
Which is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU and the crisis of the social democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent peaked since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country by Alexandr Lukashenko, instead according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is rather explained by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
While the country's legislature of 10 million people, composed of one percent and ten Deputies, more than a decade ago there is no opposition, before yesterday's elections the opposition united under the name of United Democratic Forces (SDP) expected Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his term after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time would "allow" the entry of some opposition MPs into parliament.
So the STO suppressed the boycott it originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia - that took credit for moderating Russia's increasingly expensive natural gas import and which contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the pipeline passing through the country - sestant to improve its relations with the European Union , which does not give Lukashenko and other high-level politicians permission for having a political regime considered undemocratic.
It was a sign of détente when the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, emphasized positive phenomena rather than mistakes - such as a ban on participation imposed on a third of opposition candidates.
However, Monday's primary OSCE report criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates were unable to appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has now considered the two regions independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but most importantly the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun, " declared our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the candidate of the opposition of the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime fears allowing the entry of even one opponent into that parliament without weight."
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations when they see the results, rather it tries to get voters their message about the need for economic reforms.
"This clearly causes us a lot of problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities are making difficulties in the face of distribution, but even so I see that more and more people are supporting change among the elderly as well," Milinkevich said, alluding to lukashenko's regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security , do not consider it appropriate even retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the scheme.
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the breakdown of social security that "resembles the silence of cemeteries" - milinkevich opined.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, called elections democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but facts", so that the lack of opposition is nothing more than the testimony of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Marseille's global menu
European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutually trade partners, this issue in addition to the other mostly global problems dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great developing democratic power that should have more say in international affairs but member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been dealt with at the ninth summit launched yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President-in-Office José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana as chief representative of foreign policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India with which they reached an agreement to double their trade by five years, i.e. increase their trade to more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
Thus, they legally harmonized the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India until the end of 2009 wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only in ninth place among the Union's trading partners.
The summit paid its attention to global affairs.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of the latter - and pressed for the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also pressed, although both sides have a great responsibility for its failure.
The EU confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. until 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least twenty per cent.
India also agrees with this, just as next year's climate conference should reach a global agreement and reduce greenhouse gas production by fifty percent by 2050.
They also wished to hamper rising food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today India's head of government will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive commissions worth twenty billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers to the international exhibition of the Frankfurt book.
More than three hundred Italian editors will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book awaits for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
He will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
A meeting with the stamp will continue in the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present numbers, trends and prospectives about the state of publishers in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors progressively decreases on the total Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Brunetta: "From now on you have breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Palacio Chigi that they put up automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
but from today you start with this measure against whom you sign and then go to the bar for a coffee during working hours.
This novelty was presented today by the Minister of the Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors," Brunetta says, "are an instrument for working better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services," the minister says.
"Now a new season of accountability and transparency opens.
This is Reformism," Brunetta says again.
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been found on the part of employees, says the secretary general: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on their part."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and crescents.
Brunetta's word, suggesting, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Public Administration High School
of Rome, the minister states that "in three months absences from diseases of public employees have been reduced by 50%, means 60 thousand more people to work in a year."
He adds that the Public Administration needs to perform more effectively
Italian, "which wage dynamics," explains the minister, "over the past 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above the inflation rate."
For now millions of public employees have come together to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service shows the numbers, the slightest absenteeism of work due to illness," writes the association of consumers , "the people of 'lazy workers' are constantly increasing.
There are millions effectively in Italy the right and productive public administration employees who have come together to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree."
In particular, the Tar will respond to the exclusion of economic treatments added due to illness due to service; the extent of the time sashes in which medical control visits of the sick employee are made, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents are checked at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
By 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths in homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the very tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says Republic President Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, a national association mutilated and invalidated by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and public awareness".
"It has manifested itself, a 'sufficient', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, because of their dimensions, provoke the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead everyday reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular significance take the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness of the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep attention to the phenomenon alive, not to sound the alarm about social gravity, to implement and improve legislative rules.
For his part, The President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini underlined "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to urgently put an end to it".
"The data on accidents at work seem to point to a slight positive walk, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive," said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "downward trend" to translate into less attention, because that is precisely when attention diminishes that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that too little is done at the general level to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our view - Mercandelli has highlighted – greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school."
"It serves a further effort," he added, "as far as communication and public awareness concerns.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary guardianship envisaged for the victims of work" and the "assistance referral to which the system is being directed in recent years".
"The aim is to restore the worker to the insurance guarantee - he added – because the fate of the one who crashes does not have to depend on the dediva arranged by the legislator each time."
Mp3 readers under accuses, put hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for a long time using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission refers to, which in a statement issued in Bruxel cites the scientific commission's view of the EU's emerging and newly identified health risk (Csrseri), published today.
"From this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and high acoustic cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears irretrievably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific evidence – Ue responsibility follows - a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is raising awareness of consumers and giving up this information in the public domain.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and have the step with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that this causes.
"Scientists, the Eu executive concludes, "confirm that it is a concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders that measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable musical devices and related devices."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as hearing damage can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit this damage a lot by resorting to solutions such as the reduction of levels and the time of exposure to noise.
In its view, the Ue Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices listen at high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the currently in force limit on the maximum noise allowed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Rome, German gives the way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be held.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors were closed in March, the board and the communal council evaluated analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Piano for Rome with the "official bun" of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – Alemanno tends to stress – It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then endorse.
There is no leftover position of roles, only the willingness to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March the jobs will disappear, because this experience must have an accurate temporary finish.
In June – announces the mayor – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
To whom the Commission accuses it of being useless, since its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work to be done by the Commission and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, your contribution will be essential.
Politics is almost always crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that back and forth manifest themselves.
On the contrary, we want to look further and in the long term, in a deeper prospective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
The mayor of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless body nor a banality: it is absolutely free, not coastal a euro for Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds that the capital squeezes".
For Alemanno, indeed, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, of which we have absolute need, thinking in a unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, the mayor of Rome needs" would not only be limited to the current communal confines but looked beyond" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but also "also considering the role that Rome can and should play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that he is interested in going through as an independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today gives a private citizen) to the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as election date approaches.
has written a lady from Miami on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he thinks he won the highest office in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!"
They're actually attacks that don't say much; are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says Obama won and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there is one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A Newspaper of the Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote we will know who the American patriot will give his vote to.
There comes one side of the American mindset covered to the last.
"Say what you want, we'll think later about where to put the cross, whether about Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama gets to win, we'll leave America.
things never said before now, it seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
Yet, despite all these reasoning, the winning weapon for the democratic is George Bush.
They have asked 1500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 per cent have replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Likewise, Iraq for most has been Bush's weak point.
Whoever will assume George W's position will have a huge duty to unwrap.
It uses, economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it is cut-out time. Many blame the Internet, "murderer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been challenged by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
While journalists today are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as most of the public understands is not to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism dominates the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following the wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap in the Internet, much to be seen as the "murderer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" journalists warn has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope "that it will do some good" for journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between those who run the newspapers – that is, the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives nationwide are confident that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage rate drops to 23%.
For some this has to do with "job security".
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationally.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The "safe work" thing at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under a contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of "take it or leave it."
Directors almost always receive good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, "get sick" followed during the year.
It's all a matter of weather.
UNIPOL: ROME COURT, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of real estate company Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is bankrupt in the field of research on the Unipol-Bnl counter-pact.
In the course of the arrest process in his charge, last week, he obtained home liberation, transforming it into compulsory residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate company be able to travel the route of the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (by which the pm has voted otherwise) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days earlier with the vote of the representatives' camera against the $700 million saving plan launched by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
It gives us a confirmation from yesterday's New York Times informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican Party, always more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the other hand, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the central and southern states.
The soul, in fact, has become overbearing with the vote of the one who spoke at first.
This is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here alone.
Whether in the United States or Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to function as an accelerator for incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-updating, extraordinary revival, of the dual status-sovereignty category in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions - financing which, if, strong relations you would finance with abroad, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more committed.
The one that immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is to say how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those individuals and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially offside or they do not have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union which, as always, is divided between different interests and different state strategies, cannot decide any common policy.
It is up to the government of each state that everyone expects intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the subsidization of funds: from the moment you reach the court it is only the state that owns the economic resources and the mass of resources financed to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two invaluable resources, values in certain circumstances in which no market is likely and no organization can ever dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a very collided factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of the intangible, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to do the accounts more and more with unmaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, note, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are equally united in absolute mode in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever is sovereign certainly has many more letters regarding those who are not, and those who have the misfortune to live in a post without crops, without oil and without water.
I get to the second novelty that but foreshadows a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of one who knows how to take the situation into hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, of inadequate re-released economic species with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of Western countries in a growing number.
It seems to advance ever more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far booming, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the sympathetic exception of the end, to have made their own time and to be stranger to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, In short, it underground fuels a branched but powerful movement of delitimation of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an electoral "revolt" or in the sudden changes of collective humors of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of american congressmen against Bush (and also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with it).
It is clear that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say any, will always make it more difficult to understand and then represent, what is now taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and which the economic crisis renews, increases and potentially shakes inordinateness.
In the face of all this talking about a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spider-Man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come quite close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to have a 100-kilogram body glued onto a vertical wall.
THE STUDY – The American Journal of Science has published the findings of some researchers from The University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by gecko paws, coated with microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal perfect adhesion.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful from the legs of this reptile and at the same time"easily takes off from the walls", explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Engineering Faculty at the University of Dayton.
WALK THROUGH THE WALLS? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive"adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through walls exactly like Spider-Man? Layers do, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use like the connection between electronics, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could have to do with aerospace engineering.
At the moment no superheroes.
OTHER RESEARCH - Also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California scholars have presented an adhesive made of micro fibers like hair that self-cleans the dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken contemporonally with some drugs their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing, as the case may be, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packaged that fresh ones associated with the assumption of some medicinal David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway to Philadelphia sends a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple is enough to reduce the absorbency of some drugs , nullising beneficial effects and putting patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already under accused because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic medicinal, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicinal products.
PHARMACACOS TO RISK – The same Italian drug agency had made the news in an information bulletin two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what is being drunk in the case a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone is being assumed.
NOT ONLY POMELO – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of the active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From here the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of Milano State University: "These discoveries in general are pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative brochures of the medicinal products that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let ourselves be impressed, ask clearly the doctor or pharmacist", stressed the expert of the agency Ansa.
The Novel of Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to american Paul Krugman for his studies, trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian neo-Keynesian who teaches Princeton University and is a new York Times editorial noto.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001, attack, in those days after Enron broke, Krugman had foreseen in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggered a lot of controversy and that for several years came reproached to the economy, but which has now been revealed to be accurate.
"I am surprised and a little annoyed by how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman told the 2002 fine.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Banking Executive Committee, Krugman is a "high-value economist," but also a "very aggressive, particularly critical of the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism."
Open Office, echoes the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It's the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After a nearly one-year job by volunteer developers, of whom their backs are watched by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: to the welcome screen and to the less rude magazine interface, more consistent ones are added, such as support for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 ,the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also to multi-functioning with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the dimension of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via electronic post, or the possibility to import the PDF file into the graphic processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graph of adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word er.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should give the ultimate result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at the http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English version that was in the mirror since Friday.
Also for Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can also send the installation cd home or to work.
And if the theme of the free can be a hook for dissemination in the houses, it is in business that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, being able to already have several projects carried out in the public administration and in the schools.
And there is not a shortage of realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and support service for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint presentation; Dbase, eat in the case of the well-known Access is the program that consents to work on the data base; and finally Draw the graphic module.
Target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to this day we reach almost already 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version is likely to exceed the expected figure.
Also Kohl proves positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case on the tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, third-placed and winner of the climber's best shirt.
To break the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive runner to the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricc, and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from the Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of Kohl's blood champions enters among those carried out in recent weeks in the laboratory of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose third place to the Tour and go against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positive doping to the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the news.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, awarding himself the shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES WONDERS, ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy as a country of migrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
Is this turning the beautiful country into a nation of racists? That's what the New York Times wonders in a long article he has devoted to the debate on racism in Italy on the case of young Abdul William Guibre originally from Burkina Faso killed the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times defines the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are recorded, but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support in the Northern League."
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
The new legislation wanted by the Lega also tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Trend marked by the Pope that by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano finding Benedetto XVI in Congress has called for the state and the church to work together to combat racism".
Found Steve Fossett's plane the millionaire missing a year ago
The wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris has been found on a plateau at an altitude of 3000 metres, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, in the Confine between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Wood County Commissioner John Anderson has dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we've sent a squadron, and now we have confirmation that it's typical of what Steve Fossett was flying over on the day of his disappearance," he said at a stamp conference.
The Commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found on or around the plane.
The millionaire, 63, has been killed in February.
The American Office for Transportation Safety (Ntsb) has made it known that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a squad of investigators has been sent that has identified the device: it is typical of the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada confine, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents under the name Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a hoodie.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
By 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world's turn in a hot air balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world's turn by plane and non-stop.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters di altura, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv outside the schematics with an original and well-established design with defined lines and certain angles.
This is, in short, Glk the last born among the "compact" off-road vans of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Own for the non-traditional content, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the suv Glk, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car will launch an unreleased mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, first used in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that dominated the central street of Milanese shopping, Avenida Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed in avenue Como it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will get the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of innovative Elumina8 technology the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? See.
it's clear who the Italian hooligan are
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sporting events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has followed the Italian National for years and which until now, to tell you the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they've never met the rival's fans either.
The extraction of the group is right-wing.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
A small group (few units, actually) of the Campaign and Puglia have been added to these in Sofia.
They have three-colored flags where the militants' home city appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
English fans are inspired.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of the Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all already with the names, making them easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among what had come out for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at the time, none that had forbidden him to frequent a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have been rejected for the ticket and also for the trip.
Now the interior ministry hopes to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) that prevents frequenting not only Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans won't set foot in a stadium anymore.
Luckily.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others will be added.
"We need to put out this fire right away and not legitimize who behaves in this way," they argue from the Ministry of the Interior.
That's why "eyes are wide open" especially in view of Wednesday's National party in Lecce."
In Puglia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia bras.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also have a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, i.e. the secret service, which deals owns the problems in the stadiums.
"Duce-Duce's choirs and his arm raised during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria it is not a reato ...".
This is the thought (express in an ungodly way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the post that was formerly francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been Trieste's head of public safety where there is a core of bras from the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not reluctant to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behaviour of those 150-200 fans that has been shameful.
"I don't do the sociologist," adds The Observatory No.1, "the reatos are attributed in the countries where the fact happens.
Until now this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles in Mameli's hymn: they are also not a haven, but if they allow they are not of education either..."
Students who are victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rent market for college students doesn't know the crisis.
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the union of tenants, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Napoleons, 600 to Rome.
"The phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to sustain," explains Sunia's office manager Laura Mariani, "in these cities strong demand has completely distorted the market to the point of triggering a process of widespread increase even for residents."
In most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: freestyle contracts, unregistered, no fee limit, sub-linked rentals.
Extraordinary interventions are needed for Sunia that, through the revision of taxation, can regulate prices.
Looking in detail at the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Bologna Square) you are asked for approximately 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt.
It is made economic only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina area, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed you are served 300/450 euros, for a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed you are served 250/350 euro, at least 350 for a single.
in the smallest cities the prices are lower in absolute finishes, but it has a greater weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of student and non-EU rentals is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: a 25/30% increase in the levy on foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, the city cancels the historic halls
Historic cinemas close favoring multiplexes.
"A city without movie theaters in a blind city is like an eyeless face."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographer with effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of large meticones on the periphery and the consequent disappearance of mono-rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and undisputed event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory, "it is as if a friend died, a acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much emotion was shared", Observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won cousin Oscar and the grand jury prize to Cannes, which told the poetry of a provincial cinema and nostalgia for the way of life the cinema that lost such a cinema once and for all.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of traders, are clear: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay most are mainly the halls of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Napoles, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most suffered by closures are as first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, following Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the one responsible for its disappearance is the coming of the multiplex, these three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new meticones cinemas are their own: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 whether in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it would be useful if new structures were built but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of existing ones, because when a city hall closes, not all of its frequenters are willing to transfer to the hives.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of traders: the state's previous debt is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful ethically and morally disgraceful that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year."
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that worried about closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the mono cinema room is in the historic center that on the periphery.
Among the rules envisaged there are mediated tax facilitation in favour of managers and advantages for the public in mobility endings: spectators will be able to enter the limited traffic area and have special rates for parking.
"It's an initiative I like," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by putting other measures on its feet.
It is true that to contrast the extra power of the emoticons, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of the sound and image because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me was always important: the closure of Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Paradiso cinema", which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk past the Rialto or the Quirinale via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the signs blackened by dust, I turn to the other side".
Link between politics and 'ndrangheta, Gioia Tauro mayor arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniformize the elections of the Municipality for those interested to the Piromalli cosca".
Heavy are the accusations that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the mayor and vice mayor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by Mafia association.
Also arrested were Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his lawyer grandson, the boss's namesake, already convicted of mafia criminal association and compensation for 10 million euros.
"Despising any legal and moral norm, and of good sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been allowed to the Mafia family," the judges write, "to officially enter the municipality's intern, facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The chairman of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean."
This morning's arrested are added to those from last July after police had announced the cut-off of heads of the Pyromalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, gioia Tauro's municipal council had been dissolved, as far back as 1991 and always because of alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of udc at the time of dissolution, after the balotage in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
I exploit a scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call on the deputy interior minister who at the time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything on a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the ambiguous interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges "the availability to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration over the interests of mafia families".
When energy is born from the waves, the greats come down to the stage
It is an exterminated site that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the world's largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which big ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s along with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of low oil in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was set aside, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give the sector momentum.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated by 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity need could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This amount would be twice that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies they have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology," said the spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil colossus to the Wall Street Journal - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is on obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It's a pretty important sign, considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil, and president Bush has recently activated a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, even if they are not detailed indicate a growing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology even at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts like those Portuguese or Scots are small in size and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a long scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And there are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a boa system attached to each other.
The force of the waves, which moves the boas up and down becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure spins a turbine that in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore via underwater cables.
For now, four implants of this type in development, pending only federal approval, in addition to energy, could serve a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a mall and a parking lot, using underwater turbines on New York's East River.
The movement of water when there are tides, rotates the paddles of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long cast of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the development of electricity, merita at this time the potential of tides.
While it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mainly about the energy of tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others approaching the coasts, have invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.

On an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend
While calling the emergency line with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and it was imperative that they come to their home.
Lamb set out that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset to the house, and that contacts on the family of the dead woman could be found on her phone.
Inside the police, the body was found by the police and a handwritten message on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could go back, I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me," the letter, according to the authorities, was signed by Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Misselandi, would go 300 miles to the school campus where police believe he shot favorite Professor Ethan Schmidt at his office door.
The chief of police at Delta State University, Lynn Buford, said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb is said to have made a fateful call to the emergency line shortly afterwards.
Finally, another death came; Lamb had taken his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school, it forced the students and the faculty to hide behind the locked doors, the commissioned authorities still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details released by the state investigators, as well as the students and staff who knew him, together created an image of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or a violent history.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote in thanks to the "great people" with whom he shared an academic life.
The two taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, along with 17 other faculty members, and many students took courses at the same time.
There were also inclinations in terms of problems.
A student who was praising Lambo, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaky, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him that he was facing stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave for health reasons, stating that it had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the recruitment of university staff meant that a doctorate in which Lamb worked hard would not guarantee him an automatic term to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb seemed to be troubled by something."
These questions will no longer be answered by Lamb.
After leaving the campus, police picked up his trail as he crossed the border of the state of Arkansas back to Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single pistol shot in the yard of the house about a mile from his parents in the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of the state of Washington, Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb had gone to this house, though Johnson had said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this region.
Lamb began working at the University, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has a population of about 1,2000, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamba's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through their mutual friends.
She was in high school with her friends, and he was the great older kid who tutored her guitar for several years.
He was quite a heartbreaker at the time.
All the girls' hearts softened as soon as it appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the outskirts of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for a while.
During the emergency phone call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they separated 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely slumped," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when he and Abigail trawled to the summer festival three years ago.
They later played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, the bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a scantily lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamba and Prentiss on the night of September 5, the sweat Lamb had finished playing guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"They were just a happy couple," he said.
We lached and recorded each other for a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the slain professor, led the first-year seminary and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the Boys' Student and Student Government.
At the Cleveland Delta State campus on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and community members, attended a commentary event with candles.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother, Jeff Schnidt, also attended a vigílie during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, the school began again.
"We're trying to get our students back," La Forge says.
The crisis is over.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
The Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to the report.
This story was edited to reflect the fact that police now claim that Lamb made a call to the emergency hotline after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us claims not to have as many seasonal workers as they did last year, but the child toy and product manufacturer says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, a decline from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company claims to start recruiting the bidders this month and will recruit staff until December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to help out at the shops and the sale, for the dispatch and delivery of the goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to come to be, when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in time."
The film begins and I realize I'm at the top of what you might call a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Returning in time," is a documentary about "Return to the Future," which states interviews with Fox, Leo Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It is, admittedly, the best travel document ever filmed for me."
"Retched in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of nearly five years, and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial meeting at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and among the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unsolvable."
The Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity shown by reaching the Iranian nuclear deal in addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to label him as a man who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hand like a faded joke.
And some are preparing for the implosion.
But whichever Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they are failing (yet).
10 of the last 11 national polls show that Donald Trump is in charge for a double-digit number, and some people are beginning to seriously ask what this real estate magnate's nomination chances means.
Of course, it is only the start of the election cycle.
None of this says that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of 2011, the leadership of Rick Perry made the move to rise to Herman Cain, and in the end neither of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run into the general election.
But outside groups like Jeba Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and are starting to unload their dollars at the stand in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a fleeting phase:
Trump's assessment of favorability was reversed by 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's vote showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers stick at the beginning of the stages.
After the Quinnipiac University vote last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthistered" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two of the 10 said they would be "spurious" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "enthriggered" against the 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "unsatisfied" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush became the candidate.
Most Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompousness and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are sympathy for the nationwide to think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for the presidency, according to a ABC News/Washington Post vote on Monday.
The same number is held in the Iowa state senatorial club, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think they have a commander's personality, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have a personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn't belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
Asked who would most likely win the GOP nomination, four of them said that Trump would be the best option, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full publication: GOP voters have not had the brightest crystal ball in the past.
At the time of the past cycle, 4 of the 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry as the winner of the candidacy against 28 percent for Mitt Romney's eventual nomination.
Still, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Even as Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump is still beating almost everyone.
Some scholars stress that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely disseminated among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct contest between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always win majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally by Randal Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christio by 33 points apiece.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead the dealer by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
A bald majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they have already made up their minds.
Tuesday's new CBS/NYT poll shows that only more than half of voters supporting Trump say they will not change their minds.
It's obvious that a lot of things can change that, and no one can really say that they would never change their minds.
46 percent say they keep their back door open for a change between the candidates.
Still, Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider fellow neurosurgeon, Ben Carson, but voters who see their opinion as finite would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump about the issue of immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called Mexico's immigrants "rapists" in his campaign's announcement speech, immigration is still sticking to the main and central theme of the 2016 conversation.
Some fear that Trump's pomposity will lure key Hispanic voters away from the Republican party and damage the pursuit of rebranding.
But according to a new ABC/Post Monday poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the subject of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain, too.
Frustration with the government is reaching new highs.
Today, Donald Trump and Ben Carson receive about half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their outsider status.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post vote on Monday say they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry with Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg vote in Iowa revealed a few weeks ago that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent were "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hell-eyed."
The House supported a larger share of the state's coal fees.
The Czech Republic will raise more than 400 million.
At first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of the proceeds of fees from the open-cast mining of lignae o'clock from the mining company.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised MPs that this would give them extra money from both the state treasury and the budgets of municipalities.
The draft was criticized by opposition MPs, who fear that the mining firms will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act at first reading, which means, among other things, that the state should receive a larger part of the revenue from the fees from the green coal's surface mining fees from the mining company.
The state's share will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will be reduced from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also changes the way the cost of the mineral reimbursement is being mined by companies.
The change in mineral extraction fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state coffers than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenue of municipal budgets is to be neutral because the fee is to be higher.
In the year before last, municipalities received roughly CZK 450 million of the fees and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal was worth about 200 million crowns to the municipalities and the state to 66 million crowns.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the remuneration from the extraction of the premises with the permitted mining to CZK 1,000 per hectare per hectare per year.
The revenue from these reimbursements is to continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that this would gain municipalities annually instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The payment is newly calculated as the product of the amount of extracted mineral and the rates for each mineral variety.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda, however, warned against the fact that the charging of the fee by decree of the government may not be in line with the constitution.
According to the Minister Mládek, however, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral, which is state property.
Fees are received only by municipalities whose territory is affected by the mining.
In the case of deep-sea coal mining, three-quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will be for radioactive rock extraction.
The part of the money the state collects in the mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after the logging or to provide the Mining Rescue Service.
The draft was criticised by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that they would damage the municipalities affected by the mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to have the Minister of Finance improve his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) chosen in the Ústí Region.
Ahead of the rise in unemployment in the Most, KSČM MEP Hana Aulická warned.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kucera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to the mining firms, the fee increase will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent contracted for a long time.
So major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel price rises felt.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in reimbursements by seeking to reduce their operating expenses, which would mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, according to her, the increase in fees is acceptable in terms of employment.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment, Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government's decision on the coal mining limits before the law is approved.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have repercussions for revenues for both the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak army should not be made until after 2020.
The limits at the CSA mine should be breached for social, economic reasons, and for the sake of the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Veselý will lead the Czechs as the number one, the dedication will be affected by the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the board at Thursday's draw for the Davis Cup draw in India, and this time each of them is likely to hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil plans to break the load over the quartet, given the difficult conditions.
Delhi is hot and high humidity, so difficult matches are expected to stretch to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out by the weather.
And depending on how it will look, Navratil said during today's Czech selection training session in the centre of Rádz Kumar Khánna.
He is counting on the team's number one and the world's 40 Jiří Veselý for both Friday and Sunday's singles.
The number two position is likely to be Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek.
I'd like almost everyone to get involved.
It's slow in my head, but I'm not saying it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech line-up should be Štěpánek's participation in Saturday's doubles.
It's just a question of who will stand next to an experienced doubles player who has a record of 18-4 in the Davis Cup in the doubles.
It's not going to be hilarious.
There are options with Rosol, or Adam Pavlasek.
"I really don't know who with whom and what it's going to look like," said Navratil.
He will decide on the development of the doubles.
Pavlasek may be a variant, with Veselý surprised in the first round with a win in the doubles over the Australians.
"He is decent for the doubles," said Navratil.
I did it against Australia and if I play, I would like to perform the same performance I showed there from the second set.
"I am happy for the experience and I would like to bring a point," Pavlasek said.
The home side will put in the doubles of Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP rankings), who won last week's Challenger in Shanghai, where he beat the third and fourth rankings.
The number two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They are both Challenger players and our players have ATP Tour experience, but we have convinced ourselves many times that the rankings in the Davis Cup do not make the difference.
"It's the form of the current form that decides, the weather," said Navratil.
Friday's opening singles will start at 6:30 GMT and can stretch out for the weather.
The forecast is expected to rain and the court is not under the roof.
However, the game can be played under artificial lighting.
They've already lit it up, and it's got some two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be put to be played under the lights," said Navratil.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut in the PMQ is highly anticipated
The new working leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and will work with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions assigned shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be closely examined by the media and the Members.
In a week-long statement, he asked for "less theatres and more facts."
He also said he could skip the few sessions he would leave for his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC's annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to quietly meet with criticism from a number of Conscripts during the National Championships in the service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of attention on several stories on the front pages of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
Mr. Corbyn's spokesman said he'd be "frightened in a respectful silence" and that he would acknowledge "the heroism of the Royal Airships in the Battle of Britain."
However, Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he would recommend to the Labour national anthem to sing "no no averse" on his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn's top team, quoting differences in the economy, defense, and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a leader.
The BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, says that the political differences in the work are also "supplied" after the appointment of Mr Corbyn through his position in the European Union and the government's benefit limit.
Mr. Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had put forward amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the benefit limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of the shadow work and pensions, said that the party had "very clearly opposed the government's plans to lower the limit from £226 to £2233,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers' Party, faced by David Cameron in the last decade since his election as Conservative leader.
The leader of the labor party, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has "out of the crowd" ideas for questions for Mr Cameron and have received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that the PMQ is too confrontational and that they will refrain from both "shot responses" and toothed trade, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn argues that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him on PMQ if he does not attend-such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also abandoned the idea of letting other colleagues get out for him from time to time, because he had been told that he had discussed the matter with House spokesman John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" policy style, which was often associated with the PMQ but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of the leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House and their position among other MPs, even though critics have argued that they have become a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Flock in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
But a group of ex-opens street kids found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to make photos of their neighborhoods and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound is rising as pay rise in the UK accelerates
The pound jumped in the following dates and showed the recovery of British wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was guided higher up with the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and June, the profits of GB, including bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
That was the fastest time since 2009, and it looked like the estimates of when rates would rise closer.
Sterling was climbing more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro at €1.3730.
FTSE 100 index closed to 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped by 20% after receiving an outsourced bid from his rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and an approach to brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up 0.9% after encouraging news from rivals' luxury merchandise group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose by 5% after the mining giant said they rose by $2.5bn through shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in the Packing and the Mondi paper group were the biggest drop in the index and fell by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs downgraded his rating to the company for "sale."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after sports company announced an 83% jump in mid-year in pre-tax profits from £46.6m
JD Sports chief says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports Executive Chairman, Peter Cowgill, says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that purchasing power will outweigh the higher wage costs at his company, he says.
The costs could be hit by plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment building marshmallow are cheering.
The controversial structure got a stop sign.
The investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
The construction, which is to be created in close proximity to the Agnes Monastery in the centre of Prague, was protested in front of the Prague 1 office by a petition.
The Municipality stated in the decision that the building code had been breached because not all the requirements of the zoning decision had been complied with.
"The zoning decision in question does not contain certain elements, such as the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, the sufficiently clearly and comprehensibly described the shape of the building, the delimitation of the territory concerned by the reason of the construction," his decision reads.
The magistrate also considers it illegal to consider that some of the documents for the decision were issued for the documentation currently under discussion, but which has changed.
This is the position of the environmental authorities, for example.
Part of the construction is to be created on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid approval.
The dossier shows, however, that in doing so, however, the landowner only provided approval of the project documentation for the zoning procedure, not the consent to the placement of the construction on his land, writes the Building Regulations Department.
According to Francesco Augustus Razett of the investor company, the Building Regulations Department did not take note of the decision of the superior body - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the deadline for the start of the review had already expired.
In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, abide by all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people dubstrate for the co-creation's supposedly designed color of the facade, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people have gathered in the city centre in the past to protest the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby houses resent the fact that some of the permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inappropriateness of the building for the historical centre of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Anežna Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original version of the 2008 project, which was envisaged with a glass facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NPÚ) and revoked the permission of Prague's monuments in 2010.
The new project of Praga Progetti e Investimenti with face-shaped windows was approved by the NPÚ and the Municipal Monuments and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the criticisms of the opponents, saying he never counted on the façade in pink, which gave the project a nickname after pink and white confectionery.
A Czech politician gave the migrants a ride.
The Hungarians put him and them in jail.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
On the way, he and the crew took three Syrian refugees to the car, who he said they wanted to climb for about half a kilometer.
It was not yet criminal in Hungary at the time, he told People's Daily.
We knew the law enforcement officers did not sanction such conduct.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transferred us to pre-trial detention in Szeged, he described to the paper.
The politician ended up spending nine hours in the cell.
The police were said to have behaved correctly, but communication was delayed as they did not speak English very well.
Prison, however, was trite.
For example, in our cell measuring about three by four metres, 15 refugees from Syria were crowded.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up there for the next day and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them next, Berg said.
What can't be entertained?
Ask the president of the Chamber of Executors.
On Friday, September 18, the president of the Chamber of Executors, Mgr, will answer the questions of readers from 9:30 a.m. Pavla Fučíková.
You can ask her about changes to the Executions Act in force from 1 September 2015 as well as other items related to executions or executors.
Metcash launches campaigning in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches campaigning in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relations with local food suppliers and are building the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are joining with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's, offering tastings at IGA stores, and shop owners selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, with food, alcohol and hardware retailer celebrating its annual investor strategic day.
There is a lot at stake because in southern and western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA's business steps and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and Western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the SA and 24 percent in the WA, compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will be framed for 5 percent of the food market in the two states in the 12 months since the opening of the first stores that have taken over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week, in a report by analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that the IGA retailer could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the Western for the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes at the fixed price base of Metcash could cost it around USD 13 million in pre-tax returns, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that shoppers at IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the fund's senior manager, Hamish Douglass, founder of the financial group Magellan, said business lunches in Melbourne could "highly disappear in a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglass's comment.
But it is known that Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and the profits from the Metcash food business, which supplies about 1,200 retailers to IGA, have fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operating development of the change in speculation as sales and yields are under pressure.
However, the wholesale business has gone on the counter-attack and is investing more than $150 million a year to compare the counter-coups for the Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers reunite by adding fast-growing food and news from private citizens.
Metcash's executive director, Ian Morrice, says that price-computing and store retrofitting programs will catch the grain and hope that the wholesaler will return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserved fame for his behavior, rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a secondary loss at a recent fuss about his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, says Tennis Australia's president, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention thanks to an affair with the notorious Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a keen qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, had to be twice separated by the referee, Harrison said afterwards: 'Wawrinka should have drawn one to Kyrgios and I should have drawn it, too.'
While he was last seen smashing his racket after a cramp derailed by Richard Gasquet's possible climb at the US Open, Kokkinakis steadfastly defended Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he is competing with Sam Groth for a second-round appearance behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I thought quite intensely about the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little involved in the whole dispute," Healy says.
He destroyed his racket when he lost because of a spasm at the US, but he is not the first player to take out his racket's anger because of his frustration. I know Thanasi well enough, and I can tell he's not going to be proud of this event.
But he was in serious control very well because he was subjected to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a great deal of credit.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he was treated with a bit of a hard time.
He is a very adult 19-year-old man, he works very hard and he fits into the team great and so on, he never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he is in an amazing condition, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I just think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios for an important game, which starts on Friday, and says that a "mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports the Canberra native to return to the team as a long-term standout.
"First of all, we want our team to be totally focused on the game and not all the controversy that has arisen around him [Kyrgios]," says Healy.
And I think Nick was climbing very fast, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, growing rapidly in the eyes of the public, he has also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time out of the limelight, when he will be able to think about it, is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and also for himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining those who attempted to cross it illegally to stem the flow of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants accumulated in a no-man's-land and Serbian authorities reacted with outrage.
Those who are stuck on the traps of the country between two states on the slopes of the country stand those fleeing violence in their native countries and take up residence.
But there's a sense of frustration.
When a helicopter passes over them, the migrants together call out "Open the Borders!" and berate the riot squad of the Hungarian police.
Some refuse food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declares that it was "unacceptable" to have refugees sent back from Hungary, while more and more of them are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not just indirect harm.
It will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries over the next few days," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-state bloc did not come up with a unified immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in the startled Italy and Greece and spoke with the hope of reaching an eventual agreement for the next month or at the end of the year, which would be accepted by the EU nations of more than 120,000 other refugees, including in Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened a special EU European summit on Tuesday to discuss the continental refugee crisis next week.
Nevertheless, Hungary did not cling to Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities more power to address the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up court cases of asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also planned to build a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News Coronant Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped to stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point to the European Union for Refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go for a better life and not the war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalise the violation of the 4-metre fence that the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, as well as establishing longer prison terms in prison for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by the mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged told reporters.
We are very clear about this: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, the parliament must still approve the deployment of the military, which was expected in the next week, but Associated Press reporters on the border has been watching the heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, an adviser to Orban for home defense, said the authorities were caught by 45 people who tried to cross the border and caught the 15 already in the state.
They were infiltrated by fence damage and are now charged with police custody of committing offences under new law.
The authorities quickly had the fence repaired.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a towed wired truck covered with barbed wire.
The main border crossing at Roszke arose chaos because the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container for processing and a crowd of people was being built.
About 20 of them fit in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary by refusing food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders down by half in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her lead.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (a drop from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (income from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he will want to become president, is receiving support from 15 percent of the Democratic primary electorate.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are clearly the decision to support the candidate.
But the Clinton sponsors are more sure of their selection than those who support other candidates.
Since CBS News last month, Clinton lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton maintains a big lead between women and easing, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among men has been significantly reduced and Sanders loses only 5 points to it.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now equal.
But Clinton still has a big leadership thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders is only 5 points adrift of it in that group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across the nation say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support it only for being a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
It's probably not a surprise that the current Clinton's inculcalyity is of particular fervent for her.
The looks are mixed among those currently underpins Clinton - only about a quarter would be enthusiastically supportive.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same for their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked about the open question of why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), the time is that it is time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
In addition, a great possibility of election and a match on the problems is cited.
While the vice president is considering a potential nomination for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to be in the face - a third think he shouldn't run for office.
When primary Democratic voters were asked who they would choose as a second election for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half of Biden were named as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden ran, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the best chance to win the general election; but that number fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far from second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely to be choosible are increasing.
However, when it came to the question of the candidate's greater importance, Democratic voters prefer to solve problems over the greater chance of being elected.
Like last month, neither Democratic candidate or potential candidate emerges as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, have had good results in some of the key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as sincere and trustworthy, and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden leads in honesty of the three, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have that opinion about him.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are in line with their ideological perspective.
As for all of these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state, continue, most of the primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation for the matter, saying that their overall view of her did not affect her at all.
But it's a different story among the American public.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on the subject were divided in March, shortly after the problem emerged.
Most Americans say this email controversy has no bearing on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent have worsened their views on Clinton.
These are mainly Republicans, where more than 6 of the 10 claim to have worsened their views on Clinton.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy among her party's voters, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honorable and trustworthy, a drop of eight points from last month, and by 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think it is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
But both Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush did best in the honesty.
More people see Sanders as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters didn't make an opinion.
The error margin for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson quits Donald Trump in national election
Ben Carson gets closer to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates are responsible for half of the electorate in the latest poll, and others are getting support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by an overwhelming majority, climbing from 23% of support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well across the demographic groups, and eliminates Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the fields, with the exception of Carla Fiorin and Ohio Governor John Kasich, are behind are Salzonsin Governor Scott Walker's all-on-tournament on the standout, fell to the current 2% on the stand.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together in third place with 6%.
The error margin for the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6% and held in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week, showed that Carson improved and achieved 19% of Republican support for Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is well ahead of Carson.
On the upward trend of Carson, Trump decided to shoot in blind in blind at a retired neurochirurge, and even Carson apologized for the interrogation over Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said during the Iowa campaign last Saturday.
Five members of fraternity accused of the death of first-year student Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died during the overburden ritual of the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a murder charge against five people was filed.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the commencement of the ceremony in September 2013 and was taken to the hospital by delayed, contributing to his death, police reported.
The officers report that his eyes were blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand weighing £30, and was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the target through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of Pi Delta Dogs Brotherhood did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted and reportedly waited an hour to be taken to the hospital, police say.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and basically preferred the well-being of brotherhood to Michael Deng's life," said Chief Wagner.
He was unsuccessful in his life and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck by a blunt force on the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of overburdening in fraternity, and at least one student dies every year for overburdening since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, in a statement.
The fraternity and their members must be responsible, and this is an important step by the institutions.
Monroe County's grand jury has recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault with overburdening and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to detain not only the persons involved, but if there is an organisation that approved it, officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked its relationship with the local branches.
This is what the tents when the Fed raises interest rates
Rise rises will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it's going to take and how long it's going to take.
For the economy, specifically, the history of the short-lighter's timing offers the history of the economy.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted for 86 months.
The aggarsivity of the Federal Reserve in rate hikes is often, though not always, in determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That is why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when rate hikes will start, but rather trajectories, how long normalisation will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the fuss over the speed increase can be exaggerated.
"The first Fed increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the 'cheap money era,'" Julian Jessop, senior global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to a more common but still low one to create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will react to the historical trends:
Given what the market has seen over the last month or so, the expected rate hikes may make the air a little volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for a re-stall in shares 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect the monetary policy lag," analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed's increase.
More specifically, the market in the last 35 years or often the most - about 14 percent - is heading for a rate hike in the relatively flat 250 days (average 2.6 percent increase), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average yield from the last six cycles 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the main equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said the impact on the shares tended to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle and the return was starting to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but a rate hike often helps it.
Currently, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not yet existed and could hasten a recession.
Most notable is that gross domestic product close to its lowest point in history in the Fed's hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, during 118 rate hikes since 190, only twice the nominal year-on-year increase in GDP below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to be maintained when it was at just 1.5 percent in the third quarter, reports the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky and there could be a question "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants have been prepared for the Fed's growth for a year, all eyes turning to the Federal Free Market Committee meeting this week and ending on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the upward cycles so far in a super cycle of increasing leverage effect with GDP obscuring the peaks of the start of the recession very quickly after the incipient recovery read," the report reads.
On the contrary, this was a decidedly slow recovery since the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of those when the Fed had been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we are still on.
The firm return was also volatile, as the market expects a rate hike and the model is somewhat similar to what the shares are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable for bonds than for equities when the Fed changes policy direction.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/reduction cycle.
At the end of the cycle, increases in bond yields are falling immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rate hike will cause the yields to be approached between long- and short-date bonds, which will match the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, although "we are still cautious about the strain of the decree," Kathy Jones, a fixed-pension activator at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already tailored to Fed policy expectations.
"Apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, the credit margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the US will win the interest rate after rising, and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with lots of debt will be worse off, because the dollar rising will make their products more expensive in the world market, and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the "quality" of stocks tends to surpass itself over the course of three months after the initial rate hike," Goldman Sachsve analysts said in a client report.
Companies with strong balance sheets overtook weak balance sheet companies in each interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital revenues, as well as low volatility stocks, also surpassed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of mobile interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers are also mined by the growing dollar.
Savingsmen can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized this station for 'fooling'
He takes the view that he is increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial opponent
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they just cheat the British
A colleague of the congressional colleague Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says he is not an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "change" in the Classic FM, the leading MP says, and is piling up fresh pressure to show that they are doing something that commercial broadcasts do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's chief executives that the public radio station appeared to be "fashing" and becoming increasingly indistinctable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "fooled "- but it seems to be turning into a Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, appear to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that come to mind when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC's director-general rejected the allegations on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its business rivals in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live music and make music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before, because the British are less well-educated in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's production to come under fire for treading on the heels of business competitors during the broadcast of Kultura, Media and Sport and got to the committee's hearing.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a music talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talp Media for an estimated price of £22m.
Do you see why this programme is being discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which stars Paloma Faith and the Boy George as judges - were made "in a typical BBC" scheme.
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "found a hit from its own stable" if it launches a fun series next time.
However, he refused to rule out ordering multiple future series of The Voice or spending the money of the feepayer's fee for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at their slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be to blame
For the first three months of 2015, they saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since the records themselves began in 2000
Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe the Black Friday in November could be the reason for the braking of spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, making many of Britain's main streets a ghost town.
However, experts say there are signs of stabilisation of online sales, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August was the lowest increase in growth since the start of the 2000 measurement, with an increase of just 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of stabilisation of online sales, and the new data shows a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the level of growth for the past years and you go back to 2000, the condition has always become more rationalized over time," says Andy Mulcahy, IMRG sales index editor, to the Guardian.
It explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in various contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnating, and therefore it seems to be subsiding.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken over from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the drop in sales.
The experts believe customers could be delayed in shopping before the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, five times more than the average of shoppers turned to their computers to make purchases and to drop several retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which shoppers are haggling again, can withhold customers from other purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made via web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in brick-and-mortar fashion stores.
Muslims burial victims of crane crash in Mecca and family Bin Laden sanctioned
The bodies of the 29 dead were carried over by the streets of Muslims in the performance of his first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed for the collapse of the design magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims have gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane crash at the Grand mosque in Mecca. The bodies of the victims were carried down the street.
Dressed to some extent in white, the grieves chose the path and paid their respects to the victims when the first of the fallen made his last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaissem.
The sad message passed the holy place, where only a few days earlier the building crane had pierced the ceiling of the mosque and toppled over the congregation.
The bodies were released for the funeral, and the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family's construction group over the disaster, which was also abandoned by the 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after the crane crash in the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried by the streets
Among the dead were the father of four, Qasim Akram of Bolton, the Greater Machester, who was at his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Haj Haj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Haj to Mecca will take place and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi press agency, says the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the downfall.
The English service of the disco agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's bosses were banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims cowling before the Hadj pilgrimage earlier this month.
Binladin Group did not issue any statement about the collapse of the crane and were not made to commentary by its representatives.
The royal decrees also charged the group for not using the latest security measures, and a lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive building effort headed by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and have run large construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a renegade whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The crash happened in the midst of strong winds and rain just days before the supply of millions of people in the kingdom at a fair that every able-worked Muslim must take at least once in his life.
Officials say that 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials determined that one million riyals (£174,000) would be donated to relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
The other injuries will receive half of this amount.
The head of B&Q says Eastern European traders working for the cheap are no longer a trend
Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, Veronique Laury says
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is behind the growth point
As a result, the open 200 Screwfix deals targeting traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Processed by Rupert Steiner, the main correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to be putting off hammers and brushes and handing them over to the employed trained Eastern European craftsmen to work at their home
If you're good with a hammer or a paint brush, you seem to be in the minority today.
As the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to perform DIY work at their home, according to the head of the company's company, behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the chain for home use, argues that a large increase in the number of trainees taught in Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores targeting merchants, and is closing 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms Laury says she wants to employ more women at B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions at the store make better halves.
Currently, most of the male workers are.
She said there was a need to address the growing demographic trends that are shown by more women's households, which make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Ms. Laury says: "Still in our shops, most of the time, men work in the shops.
We need to get close to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% of the decisions about the purchase of goods.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies under the UK's FTSE100 index, also recharged her top-level team to reflect the equivalence between male and female directors.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having half the representation of women among staff, including the executive and finance director.
Ms. Laura argues: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it wasn't difficult to find the good women to take to us.
Kingfisher announced a slump in profit both in the middle of the year and the sale after the group took the cost of closing the deals.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of CZK 600 to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
ODS chairman Zbyněk Stanjura noted that while the one-off contribution sounded good, it would be better to be standard indexation in the long run, as it would be reflected in the coming years.
"We have the space to find the mechanism to arrange it," said Stanjura.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaela Marksová (ČSSD), according to which it was to be indexed beyond the law next year.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said was not rosy.
The higher indexation next year, she said, would mean a budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and ministers are debating every hundred-million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that it had lowered the pace of indexation in the past.
The rapporteur, Miroslav Opálka (KSČM), pointed out that the proposal did not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The right's veto will make the paycheck much more difficult in December, and perhaps impossible, he said.
The chairman of the ČSSD deputies, Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed a reduction in the deadline for the standard in the committee to be discussed in the committee for ten or 20 days, which was also blocked by the right.
But the committee will have a month for that instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost the state a total of CZK 1.73 billion.
The money is to come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Next year, pensions should rise on average by about a penny.
The allowance should be given to the pension amendment by people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their pension entitlement before paying it in December.
But they would have to apply for the surcharge in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions are indexed regularly in the Czech Republic as of January, by price growth and a third of real wage growth.
This year, the pension is equivalent to 41.5 percent of the gross wage, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
The state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, according to the state's closing account, which was roughly five billion more year-on-year.
Spending on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all statutory expenses.
The average full old-age pension rose by CZK 104 to CZK 10714, according to data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and some 17,000 relative pensions.
Yakunin has abandoned plans for a political career, will devote himself to science.
The Senate seat was almost certain, according to Russian media.
In the Federation Council, he was to represent the Western Kaliningrad region, whose governor, Nikolai Tukanov, as the candidate of the governing United Russia party, defended his post in Sunday's election with an overview.
Under Russian law, senators are not elected by the citizens, but are chosen by the governor from a trio of candidates whose names they will announce before the gubernatorial elections.
After the election, the senator will be selected from the trio of candidates.
A complication for Yakunin was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
The Kremlin has found an exemption for Yakunin, saying he is an extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador to whom the statutory long-term residence requirement is not covered.
The filming of the Czech comedy The Theory of the Tiger has ended.
The final drop in the main character's resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Janžurová decided on her grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
It is clear to John that he and his wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová are on a similar path.
He remembers that he once had dreams of his own will, wanting to live with dignity and freedom again.
He is eager to regain control of his life - and as a solution he will choose to escape from the previous one, said Nightingale.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in comedy form in which one of the partners did not feel entirely free.
From the start, he said, it was clear that the lead role would go to Bartošek, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
Yet he is said to have been surprised by the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a lengthy break associated with the convalescence after the serious illness.
We agreed to do so three years ago.
I had him read the script, and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I was surprised that he was obviously a hooded athlete.
He used to ask the next scene where he would sit before shooting.
This time he rode his bike, climbed the rocks and even went uphill.
And all in the record-breaking tropical heat, the director pointed out.
According to Bartoška, the women are taking the tiger to turn it into a rabbit over time.
They'll pour in some of his feed, but they'll close the door right away so he doesn't accidentally think of playing outside the tiger's rabbit hut.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film about, the actor commented.
His wife, who may have a slight negative effect on the audience, was portrayed by Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic, and she means well.
But she is also a usurper and wants to bake her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also depicts the fates of John's married daughters Olinka and Alice - Tanya Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and sons-in-law of Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film's producer is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and Televízia Slovensko.
Google has promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google, an American internet company, has promised to provide an additional $5.5 million ($132.6 million) to organizations that help thousands of refugees pouring into Europe.
This was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, a charity branch of this internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled Teliček's part of the visit for criticizing human rights violations.
Czech MEP for the ANO MEP Pavel Telička postponed the forthcoming trip to Baku on Thursday because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit today.
According to Telička, Baku justifies this with last week's EP resolution, which criticises human rights violations in Azerbaijan and of which Telička co-authored.
By ruling by the Azerbaijani Telička party, he lost the possibility of talks with official partners, as well as a visit to political prisoners that depends on the approval of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
Telička wanted to use the trip, which was planned several months in advance, to meet with the parliamentary leadership and representatives of the executive as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent to the Czech Press Agency.
The EP resolution condemns the "unprecedented repression of civil society in Azerbaijan."
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent ruling on Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadadiji Ismail, who advocated for the detection of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building its air base in Syria.
On a visit to Novosibirsk, Bogdanovsky did not rule out the creation of a Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We don't have plans like that yet.
But nothing is out of the question, he said.
Russia already has a long-running naval base in Syria in the port of Tartus, which it has so far used more as a service and logistics center.
According to Russian press reports, however, since the beginning of August, supplies of Russian weaponry and military equipment to Syria have risen.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from the trade agreements in force.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to establish an air base outside the city of Latakia, which for the time being remains a stronghold of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, US commentators agree.
US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov about the situation in Syria on Tuesday, his third telephone interview in the last ten days.
Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will travel to Moscow next week to convey concern about the gathering of a Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Assad's support for Assad a lost bet.
He said of Russia's policy objectives in Syria that they were rather unclear.
Moscow, according to him, made Syria its satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what a long-term goal, according to Earnest, that is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is to be the main topic of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to today's speculation in the Russian press.
The situation in the Ukrainian Donbass region, on the other hand, is said to be not about the Russian leader at all.
According to a report by The New York Times today, the US government is not ruling out that President Barack Obama might meet with the Russian president during the UN meeting.
But the views among White House advisers are said to be diverging so far.
TASS wrote today, citing the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, that Putin does not yet have a meeting with Obama on the agenda of his New York-based residency.
Setting up the seated oil with a gallstick diet, hemp helps boost immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is the use of extra virgin oils.
When pressed cold from the seeds, all the healthy substances will remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these are the most common reason for the death of Czechs for several years.
The bladder inflammation mainly worries women, aid sesame oil.
If you are one of the lovers of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in your pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of the formation of bile stones.
These are 90% of the cause of gallbladder inflammation and women suffer from these conditions 3 times more often than men.
In general, gallbladder problems mainly concern people who do not play sports and consume a lot of animal fats.
Seasonal oil can be successfully used in a liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that the consumption of this oil brings, they should be careful about goods from the exotic food shops.
Asian manufacturers often use overcrowded seeds to press, which have a more distinctive taste.
But oil will thus lose all the active substances, described Ladislav Hačecký, the executive director from the Czech company Bohemia Olej from Kraslice in Sokolovsk, which produces cold-pressed bio virgin oils.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our press can be pressed for 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for the extra virgin designation.
At higher temperatures, nutrient substances would be lost.
Sunflower oil benefits from heart and blood vessel diseases.
The Czech favourite among the oils is sunflower.
Jarmila Hamerska's research, which she led at Masaryk University, showed that 43% of respondents preferred him in the warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, it is already starting to be overcooked at 180 °C.
It is better to use it for seasoning salads, for example, and is particularly useful in the diet in which it helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which most reduce cholesterol from all fatty acids.
For heart problems, you should be careful of the amount of fat and calories taken overall.
For example, in one spoonful of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, there are 99 calories in a spoonful of rapeseed oil.
As far as the energy value of food is concerned, it is important to realise that natural food with nutrients is much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
It is therefore advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower one lasts as sesame and hemp for 9 months.
Storage in the fridge will prolong the shelf life even further.
People recognize the old oil especially by the bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no painstaking wound to the fault.
It's a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
Hillic oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical hemp are one of the so-called superfoods, which is why hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids the body cannot make itself, and a person must take them from food.
The intake of omega 3 fatty acids is particularly important.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that the daily intake of the substance was insufficient.
The men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while the Icelanders accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hicke oil should be included in the menu as part of the supportive diet for boosting immunity and when healing injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of the cell membranes.
People need not be afraid of using hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that it is one of the best-selling in Bohemia Olej.
It is sold 500 litres a year.
People often use one of the fasting tables in the morning.
Cannabis oil is not spectacular in taste, but it will strengthen immunity brilliantly, advised Daniel Vlček from the Easter company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation in barbecues is Americans.
There's 1.4 grills for one household.
There are then various barbecue competitions around the world, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
The Czechs are not behind either.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have been ungrilling in their lives.
The vast majority of them are barbecued several times a year.
We must not underestimate the preparation to make the barbecue - the ideal is to adjust the meat by marinating a few hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is best suited for this and at the same time leaves health benefits during a barbecue?
As a general rule, in the barbecue process itself, it should be conserved with fat.
Experts agree that a large proportion of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils then also lose the body's beneficial substances, which we otherwise get from them when consuming oils from dishes prepared at lower temperatures.
But it doesn't mean that extra virgin oils don't find their use when grilling.
Grape oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When meat is said, the experts from the company Bohemia Olej from Kraslice na Sokolovsku immediately equip the grape oil.
It is wonderful to complement the taste of the meat and the fish.
The kitchen features a unique feature of enhancing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, it therefore stores health-promoting substances as one of the few oils, describes the benefits of grape oil by Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil, which is one of the few Czech producers of this vine oil.
Experts agree that the grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in fighting the excess of cholesterol.
In the grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favourable content of these substances, it helps to lower high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming the grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps to care for dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of the grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example when seasoning salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
The barbecue can therefore be used in two ways, in marinating and the barbecue itself.
By marinating the meat and the fish, we will preserve their juiciness.
Three ingredients must be present when preparing the marinade: the oil, the acidity and the spices.
For example, we deliver the acidity with apple vinegar and thus achieve the softening of the meat.
The spice in turn gives the meat the taste and the oil can preserves and gives the right edge, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, he adds, the grape oil is ideal for marinating because it can permeate it through dark meat as one of the few oils.
So the marineno mint or fish are ready to barbecue, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterised by the fact that only a few drops are enough to prepare the dishes.
The same goes for barbecuing.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to lava, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Rub the grate with oil before grilling, preventing the food from burning.
The barbecue is also a necessary part of the preparation of the attachments.
Hardly grilled meat and fish are suitable for just about anything - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, a light vegetable salad and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Olej recommend, for example, the Hot Summer Salad.
To do it you need: • 1 piece peaches • 1 bunch of rucola • 1 cup of sliced cucumber • 1 cup of salad leaf mixer • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl to the salad leaf mixture of torn rucola, sliced cucumbers and the diced peach into large cubes.
Fill in the taste with salt and pepper, you can also season with ground chilli and soy sauce.
To finish, drizzle with a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can then sprinkle the salad with finely sliced almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it is not just the medication that matters, but the will of the patient to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease, and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, aphorism, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not just about therapeutic care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations if they decide to have a child, the care of these sufferers also includes social counseling, recommendations on housing arrangements, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can be fundamentally influenced by the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and he doesn't have to fundamentally change the style of his life.
Indeed, as doctors point out, the passivity of the sufferers leaves room for disease activity.
For example, it is proven that regular movement significantly delays the time when a sufferer needs a compensatory device, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not succumb to different myths, such as that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That is why the Get a Chance page (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give Your Chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
For multiple sclerosis, the adage is twice that the treatment of the disease is treated earlier, the more likely the doctor can make an impact.
This is because we have medication for multiple sclerosis at an inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process is not so strong.
The earlier we intervene, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and delay the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
It is very important in people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often solves the weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
The patients are worked according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthening the pelvic floor, alleviating swallowing disorders or improving coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the patient's specific problems," says M. Martina Kövári, head of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine at the University Hospital Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests in a slightly different way for each.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always alleviate its symptoms.
Motion activity, however, also strengthens the body's immune status, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that the sick check for what they can do, and that reinforces their confidence.
"The exercise also flushes out endorphins and makes you feel good," the PhDr points out. Kamila Řasová from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Royal Vinohrady University Hospital.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We are directly interfering with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"Previously, these patients were so-called spared, now we know they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine of the University Hospital Motol.
Physiotherapy aims to allow a person to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including a job.
Physiotherapists are therefore working with ergoterpei to give each person a compensatory aid made to measure him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, it shakes people up.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to the heavy burden - the loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we are to go to someone, not try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them so that they will eventually come to the conclusion that even with a handicap you can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague-based manufacturer Latecoere, the Airbus would not fly.
Aircraft is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technology.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or lightweight and solid composite materials that are easy for someone to produce and process.
Still, in addition to the super-picture, computer-controlled machine tools, you can come across something as ordinary as apricot kicks as apricot kits.
In a drum that resembles a pot for a cotton candy, the pile of the stone is rehashed with the edges of the tin parts that have just come out of the milling machine.
"So far, no one has come up with anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of the manufacturer of the air door Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the area in Letňany, Prague, the former Letov produces a complete door for the Airbus A320.
They are the only ones in the world to deliver the door for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The door, part of which is being assembled in Prague, also enters the first and higher class passengers on the upper decks of the world's largest airliner, the Airbus A380 Airbus A30.
There are also commensurate doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto.
Perhaps the torque keys are being made by the company twice a year.
If there was a lack of a check-up on the yellow label, they would have some explaining to the auditors from the Airbus or Boeing in the Prague plant, who come regularly to see if the doors are made according to the agreed rules.
The human senses, however, have not yet been completely replaced by advanced technology.
There are 1,500 rivets on one door to the A320.
These must be shattered by the rioters.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the falling hammer, they can tell if the rivet is properly shaky.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The riveting of the aircraft can be climbing from zero to 0.13 millimetres.
That's about twice the thickness of a human hair.
The check-up comes to a trained touch.
When the inspector runs his finger across a series of rivets, he knows if any are out of tolerance.
Only then does he pick up the exact aberration.
The flightov fed the program of the L-39 military aircraft training aircraft before 1989.
But in 1991, neither was produced.
The company had to find new contracts quickly.
At the time, it was hooked up with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the tender for the A321 emergency door supplier.
The courtship with Boeing was not so happy.
"We were a small company for them at the time that didn't have enough money to invest and to be able to guarantee Boeing's long-term stable deliveries," Dubský recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would remain locked up if Letov had not taken the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the International Aeronautical Industry Association in 1999.
I spoke there about our collaboration with Airbus.
Negotiations with the French were underway the next day, says Dubský.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new contracts came with a strong company.
As early as 2000, the installation of parts of the door for the A320 started to be installed.
Three years later, the upper-floor door was added to the A380s.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for deliveries to the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without a Latecoere, we would not have gotten to these big contracts ourselves.
Maybe we'd be making parts or small parts.
The partners want guarantees of deliveries for twenty or thirty years, Dubský explains.
Last year, the Czech's Latecoere achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a after-tax profit of CZK 147 million.
The exclusive position among aircraft manufacturers' suppliers is not free of charge.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certifications of 170 special production processes and certificates of qualifications for key employees.
Without them, the business would not have made any aircraft doors.
Getting certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers and in repeated inspections to keep them costs millions of crowns, according to Dubský.
Production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and stricter.
We need to train employees, retrofit the facilities and re-certify the whole process, Dubský adds.
Now the company is finalizing the preparation of a process for the roasting zinc and nickel to replace the existing, harmful cadmium to human health.
They received the assignment from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The people from Boeing are coming, checking out the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They will also check our laboratory.
They test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, zooming in on the way the followers check them out.
The reward is for the Prague company's long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague plant today, the production of embrays is standing and falling.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
But it doesn't mean he can say any price outside the door.
Part of the contract is a price curve.
It indicates how many doors the one door will cost by ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces made.
The price per piece keeps dropping to a certain limit value.
We must fit into this price formula.
If not, we'll lose money, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall, where the electric cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are assembled, is still empty.
But it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen, a new semi-robotic line for rip and door assembly for the upgraded A320 Neo is being built here.
The ripening will be quickened and refined.
"This is a trend that fitting in aviation is taking," Dubský adds.
The outlet is secured by the future line.
Airbus reports that airlines have ordered 3278 new A320 units so far.
Just a few metres away, there will be a line for a complete installation of the door for the top deck of the A30.
It's a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin in two years, says Dubský.
Before that, however, the company must undergo qualification tests, for example, for the installation of some electrical and electronic door-to-door devices for the largest Airbus.
The company is also betting on the further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program to compete with the US Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit for the company to be able to process composite composites in addition to metal materials," Dubský says proudly.
However, the Latecoere is getting to the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no more place in the Letov area, where it resides.
Prior to the French mother's entry, the company had 180 employees.
He's got 800 now, and there could be a hundred more in three years.
As long as Airbus and Boeing compete for how many hundreds of new planes the airline are ordering each year, they need not worry about their jobs.
Although it has contracts for several years to come, the parent company of Prague's Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for the loan repayments in September.
In the end, Latecoere was able to reach an agreement with the main creditors.
At the end of August, she traded some of their loans for shares.
The creditors received a 37.4 percent stake in the company by increasing the capital by €57.4 million.
The company's debt fell by two-thirds, or €180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company subscribed new shares to the existing shareholders for €222.9 million.
In total, it raised the share capital by €280 million.
At the same time, the whole group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of the sales.
It expects average contract growth of four percent per year until 2017.
In the custom book, he has orders for €2.6 billion, which is equivalent to four-year production.
French media say Latecoere can finally take another breath after years on the drip.
The Czech race in Prague's Letňany is significant for the groups.
It contributes 16 percent to the group's sales.
Depending on its number of employees, it is the group's largest foreign branch.
The MPs supported the state's larger share of the coal fees.
The change in mineral extraction fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state coffers than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of municipal budgets are to be neutral as the fee is to be higher.
In the year before last, municipalities received roughly CZK 450 million of the fees and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal was worth about 200 million crowns to municipalities and the state to 66 million crowns.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the remuneration from the mining premises with the allowed mining to CZK 1,000 per hectare per year.
The revenue from these reimbursements is to continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that this would gain municipalities annually instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The payment is newly calculated as the product of the amount of extracted mineral and the rates for each mineral variety.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda, however, warned against the fact that the charging of the fee by decree of the government may not be in line with the constitution.
According to the Minister Mládek, however, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral, which is state property.
Fees are received only by municipalities whose territory is affected by the mining.
In the case of deep-sea coal mining, three-quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter of the state.
The same ratio will be for radioactive rock extraction.
The part of the money the state collects in the mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after the logging or to provide the Mining Rescue Service.
The draft was criticised today by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that they would damage the municipalities affected by the mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining firms would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to have the Minister of Finance improve his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) chosen in the Ústí Region.
Ahead of the rise in unemployment in the Most, KSČM MEP Hana Aulická warned.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kucera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining firms, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent long-term contracted.
So major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel price rises felt.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in reimbursements by seeking to reduce their operating expenditure, which would mean a reduction in the number of employees in the first place," the government admits.
However, in her view, the increase in fees is acceptable in terms of employment.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment to Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining, before the law is approved.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have repercussions for revenues for the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak army should not be made until after 2020.
The limits at the CSA mine should be breached for social, economic reasons, and for the sake of the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve is set to meet in two days' time on Wednesdays and Thursdays to make a major decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey by 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain inactive for some time, leaving interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It is a historic event because it has been a saddle flight since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get off the zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for the International Economics.
The US economy has done relatively well, with a recovery in the form of the addition of trillions of dollars to the state's account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less rosy global perspective.
They warned the markets to be prepared for an increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see great chances against this move.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday 20:00 CET.
Shooter at State University Delta left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later that day, his colleague - wrote a note claiming that he was "hunted" of the first murder and that he wished to take it back, was discovered by the government authorities on Tuesday.
Gautier Police in Mississippi said Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University, called the police around 10 a.m. on Monday morning.
and he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send the police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there was a "cute dog" in the house that "will not be annoying anyone" but was upset.
The police demanded the caller's name, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the house was fired.
When the police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lambo that said, "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me.'
After leaving the message, Lamb set out for the 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
University dean William LaForge said he knew no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "something was clearly taking place in Mr. Lamp's head."
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss's romantic relationship with Schmidt, government authorities said there was no "no evidence" of the "love triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who had been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person."
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but both remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was "shaken up" by the case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as the Sun Herald put it, Prentiss worked from the house online.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would not "go to jail."
When officers caught up with him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to a biography published on the school's website, Lamb earned his doctorate in education at Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their charms
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
He struggled with leukemia in 2001 and lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, in 2009 for cancer.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
All these things are surely taking their toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out of the game for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's defeat in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back has been left with the injury in tears and has been sidelined for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle by Héctor Moren in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke through to the PSV area.
He was treated on the playground for nine minutes and an oxygen mask was also needed before he was rushed to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in the hospital."
He will be taken over tomorrow or perhaps the day after and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a guy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18 has it very hard, but he plays fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
Crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I believe he will play again this season.
Moreno was very lucky to not get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee had been mistaken.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty procedure with both feet.
The Shaw account tweet says: "Thank you all for their reports, in words it is not possible to express how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins now and I will come back even stronger."
Related: Manchaster United recorded Luke Shaw injured in defeat against PSV
The England defender will have an added motivation for the recovery of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the field with an injury like that, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," said Cocu.
I haven't been able to see this moment.
All I saw was a ball that was headed in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see the tackle on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
It makes me feel very ill, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after the procedure of Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
This is the thing known to every parent: when a child loves a book, it doesn't take long for them to memorize it.
Of course, you mustn't be David Cameron.
Asked by a child schema provider to name a popular children's book, he was chosen by Prime Minister Lorax, a fable by Dr Seuss, a fable from 1971.
It was hard to choose, writes Cameron in a report posted on SuperCamps' website, and goes on: "Visiting, moving, creative and with strong content, I liked to read one of those to my children because there was always an image or a message behind it that I had not seen before."
Well, only then, that in the following paragraph, Cameron allegedly described the plot of the book after the lift from the 2012 film, which added additional characters and details to fill in a brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the hearts of a girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," is a brief content of a book chronicling the subject of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it wasn't suspicious enough, the text supplied by Cameron reads as the summary elevator of the film Lorax, which is found on the Internet of the Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville walled with walls where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of a girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Being an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would be acquainted with the plot of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is devastated by the raking, the trees-and-tub the industrialist of the Once-ler, who, despite the protests of titular Lorax, the crouched, shallow creature who "speaks for the trees."
In all likelihood, such a relatively little significant PR task was given to a helper who had never read Lorax to the child 20 times at a time.
A spokeswoman for Downing Street said the text was most likely from the office of Cameron's followers.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in jeopardy for England but still holding
Riveting with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the team England's selected for this tour, I don't think a repeat of the 3-90 defeat they suffered in the test series last time will be less likely.
I would also not directly rule out winning the visitors.
Alastair Cooka's party may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good players sleeping in this batting line-up, and also collective thinking is strong; they will not carry the 2012 scars, only a youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although he is unknown at the test series level, represents the attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of the England team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is a tough challenge for me to analyze, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were up against two good attacks in challenging conditions and a simple one, but the harsh reality is that the cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
There were no question marks around the name Joe Root, for example, which led to the announcement, because-and I've said this before-the players are their top selector.
A few more half-century, and Lyth could have extended his streak, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he can get more runs for the Yorkshire, there's another opportunity.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his stance, even though his performances were not entirely 100 per cent, and I'm not surprised; he was always a team player.
The question of how much test time the batter gets to show himself is a tough nut to be.
Lyth was given seven caps-as well as Sam Robson before him-while Nick Compton won nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and away.
The only thing you could grumble for is that England gave Jonathan Trott's chance in the Caribbean first-behind, despite being at its best - but this wasted opportunity is a thing of the past.
Here comes Alex Hales and that's the batter, whom I rate very positively.
He's a x-factor cricketer, cricketer, seen here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors were given, but of course all this would depend on the overall line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting at Cook's side, who would get another extra spinner while keeping four quicks, was raised and I have no reservations about it.
I don't understand why the batter can't be fired and this left-handed man has already shown that he's an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 to them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 rehearsals before his performance in 2001.
He had managed immediately three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the chance to watch him, I was intrigued by a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough stats — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a pram, but there are not a lot of spinners to raise their hands, and the selector opted for youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, it appears that England have made some changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the test matches, can be a masterpiece.
He's one of the most beautiful guys playing who brings in a lot of experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and brings both energy and a ruthless spark to the team.
I've always felt that he's been born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and, like Mahel, he possesses an intellect that can be used.
The new voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can occasionally lighten the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes got one-day leave, just as Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this decision.
Even if many disagree, coaches and selector do not form a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could prevail if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron's unpredictable strategy for keeping Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with every past day without the election of the brilliant "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to head the Workers' Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe to parade on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is mired in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States have already had enough of the British egocentric agendas, the division of concessions and disruptive changes to the treaty, which they mostly did not want.
At its one-year meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they didn't want to do so even if they erode social protection.
We can even call it a selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The prime minister and the chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home, saying they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
A European friend of mine who wants a woky Britain in Europe in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some of the short-sighted ministers and officials in some of the major cities have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before she becomes a bad one for her, as has been the case with the long-time continued Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also declining.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to watch the legs be broken in the aid of the Selfie of the British, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may plan deliberately unhelpful SNPs-style remarks during the 2017 referendum campaign in the UK to hasten the Brexit process, a friend says.
"The re-convention has solved the problem" and "Britain has no valuable negotiation."
Europeans, to their own detriment, know how predatory Fleet Street can be and how sceptical the EU is by the press releasing oligarchs barons, because they were not 2-1 in 1975-inspired referendum in 1975 that supported our entry in 1973.
They can vaguely remember the name Boris Johnson, a cunning Euro-opportunist who made his name as Brussels's "EU straight bananas" correspondent in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of bad guys not paying taxes, foreigners hacking with phones, and pseudo non-interrections that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you were in a cage with a frantic gorillas, you had to throw bananas to her to keep you from having you dinner, and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself, opposing the Cameron referendum routine, since Blair admitted the principle of the abolished EU constitution that was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and won him a drop card.
The press never forgave him either.
But the kind Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me amicably on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him that he must no longer waste his time on me - seems in the danger of accepting the regain strategy of the boycott of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to work out coherent media engagement strategies, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair he left the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe, I will say it pleasantly, is evolving.
He argues that he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the frantic tendencies of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly accept that.
Hilary said the same thing, Hilary said "Bemm, but not by Benniite" on the radio and television this week when his inner scout could not commit to admitting that Corbyn's appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But to fight to stay 'at all the circumstances' - Benn's phrase - it was by all that the phrase McDonnell was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background is, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - don't forget, he touched me - the discipline of the news remains important in the ages of all-day television and especially in the swirl, the ash of paranoia and betrayal, which are the social media
It is fair to give Cameron a free pass to Europe that would allow him to regard the Workers' Party's support in the referendum campaign as self-evident, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell's and Corbyn's basic aridation over EU membership - in line with their Bennite besieging economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic bickering.
As with his squirming about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their landlords.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions when it seems pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the brisk 'weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the costs of the Conservative government in power, as I was recalled at the launch of Monday's launch of what was the Security Forum of British influence.
Experts criticise review of electronic published by Public Health England
A statement by the government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are associated with the tobacco industry, the researchers say.
Experts writing at the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet to criticise the evidence used in their e-cigarette report by the Public Health England (PHE).
PHE released the "regime" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the comprehensive nature of the data and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editor in the Lancetus magazine last month attacked a "extremely flimsy base" on which the PHE agency was basing its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ disputed the allegations that were supposedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of efficacy."
They indicate that the public could expect that the PHE claim is "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people convened to draw up an analysis of the multi-criterion (MCDA) decision of the model to synthesise their views on the damage associated with the various nicotin-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell report that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO has reportedly previously raised funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved public health mandate BAT in the Sustainability Report, he says.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting awarded funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, but the financing it allegedly obtained earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International is supplied.
The reason for selecting the members of the panel is not available, but they do contain a few well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industrial funding in the newspapers.
Some of the other people present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting in PHE was also attended by the tobacco management.
The report produced in this group "speaks out," the missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these references or restrictions is described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the BMJ claim had already been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small compared to the case, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows, and also what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers of tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die a year from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By highlighting the current evidence - that even if e-cigarettes are not without risk, they bear only a fraction of the harm caused to smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC to end with EastEnders, former Channel 4 director says
Former Channel 4 Director Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give the right-hand man" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used for programmes that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs that are likely to be watched by only a handful of people, to difficult broadcast times compared to its rivals, "the biggest rating show, and on channels like the BBC4.
After general manager Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to join the BBC for the six years he worked on Channel 4.
"I am fighting the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programmes that would certainly have been broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson said on the Communications Commission in the Upper House, as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you keep the royalties that I am not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, the creation should be reduced, at least as far as programs that others are not produced or not awarded.
They're broadcasting The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would have broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, nonsensical.
Johnson said: 'I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without a post-contract.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced on home soil.
Honestly, other channels would give them their right-hand hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasters are.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, the show's businessman, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty about catching up with ratings "for the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the BBC's most popular show reiterates those that former Sky Managing Director, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sells the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the BBC's more cherished public service programmes "transition to the BBC4, where quite often the audience cannot be measured, but they are fulfilling their authority and can argue when they are preparing to justify the £4bn income from the royalties on their hypocritical mission, "But of course we do all these obscure programs that no one is looking at."
They're being sent out at a time when no one's looking at them.
As for the royalties fee, Johnson told the committee: "I'm calling you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people for whom £150 is a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look at the BBC as much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who spoke before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should review its reith mission in the sense of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that the BBC's small production volume was now previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take public broadcasting in Australia and Canada as a model and change into "informing, clarifying and entertaining."
On the subject of the partnership, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms, of which only a handful were broadcast on television, and join with commercial reporters so that we can see them all online.
‘Sonogenetics’ or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how the sound impulses affect the direction the nematodes move.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled by sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are hit by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching off the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists have reported that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics that uses ultrasound to activate the brain, heart, and muscle cells and activate outside the body.
Sekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain of the patient are injected into the patient's brain. The method is used for example to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
The mushroom usually doesn't respond to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction would come when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles, he discovered, are amplified by ultrasound waves, which then pass through the worms' bodies.
The reinforced ultrasound waves are active in the TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels are opening and activating the cells they are linked to, a report from the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the nematodes using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain the TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then used ultrasound for the worms so modified, the sound waves were amplified by microbububs and transferred to the worms, where they turned on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is similar in many ways to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off with the neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, has been quoted as saying that the sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fibre to the desired place in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate the tissues without any limit and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasonic signals used in clinical treatment for neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your doorstep!
Ads shaming the British arms deal.
Watch the video of the anti-Serrant Market by Amnesty International.
The menacing killer drones!
The shackles of the legs that break the ankles!
Splinky missiles!
And electric stunts that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The hilarious voice and caricature of the metaphor leave no doubt that this advertisement at the world's largest gun fairs is a harsh parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes via the defence and security facility of the International Veselice at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands district.

But a stand-alone campaign is also conducted with the surfaces of the bus stops and the metres that require a second view.
"Important announcement, DLR travel from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using a font with the London Underground signs with the DLR lines to become an image of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend to the DLR ... Customers are being asked to help stop the arms deal.
The 300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismaland.
The Special Patrol Group has helped distribute them throughout London and using the "Ad Space Hack Packs," which is £6 apiece of the Allen key, which supposedly "gets access to about a third of the planet's bus stop advertising space."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies made by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the galleries.
Many artists are switching to working with activists as part of the protest movements and realize that they must get out in the real world in order to have an impact on society in order to have an impact on their art.
Another of the anti-gun-exchange posters are health-boggled by the subway passengers.
The Amnesty video was viewed on Facebook by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without a fee and a graphic designer and a commentator also worked for free.
The VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, would be surprised by the silence surrounding the arms store ads - he saw an empty spot on the ExCeL calendar - and he thought, "Let's show them a campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They were toying with the creation of a more realistic risky corporate ad, but "adding colourful colors and animations, we've made it attract more people."
"They took a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that the torture device is not being traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the gun shop comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. military on the "arm-off AT4CS RS" arm.
This includes "a unique shaped warhead that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."

Eight golden rules for living in a student dorm
11 years ago, I moved to the student dormitories as an oblivious 19-year-old boy, still religious in the berets and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the tense smiles of those who I resent - and numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to the tracks can range from slightly on the nerves of the going to the totally appalling one.
It's tempting to babble: telling people from where you're from, if you took a year off, what your opinion of Corbyn is, and why "you sincerely don't love Marmite, because you guys, it's just an extract from HAHAHast's yeast, I'll be in your room."
Take a deep breath.
And help the others to take a breath, too - ask and express an interest.
It's conducting a conversation and it's going to help you find the people you like, and the ones you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they'd release the fire-fighting machines.
Leave the space to people.
People's rooms are often converted into drinking receptions, movie evenings spots and communal public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and customize their underwear.

The introverts in college will come up short.
Your room should be a haven foray, yet a lot of colleges turn into an out-of-peaceous walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave, to be able to return to the energy I've used up to talking to you."
Try to tell when a classmate is tired of socialization - and maybe write him a place to knock.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
A boy in my dorms was in the habit of being invited in the inside if the door wasn't locked.
He saw a few things.
Make your friends by baking.
Because you started going to the university at the height of baking mania, knocking on the foreign door, and the staging with the sheet-baked cakes, it seems slightly less strange than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked you a little something, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe it will all end by tying your face to a tasty surprise.
This is, of course, the object of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and a cottage are likely to guarantee that others will pretend to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Theft of food is a common crime in student dormitories.
The theft of the whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is there a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Check with the milk owner twice.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're raving inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more maturely than my roommate, who swapped her milk for a dishwashing device to punish the thieves.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noises that disturb people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, it's also about being the prolifting people in the glass houses.
A girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could quiet down drum and bass a little bit because it was 3 at night and had a test in the morning.
Their answer was to boost music.
When they finally fell silent at 5 a.m., she let them sleep peacefully for two hours, and then released her own music aloud, locked the door and went off for her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband went to the same dormitories as you?
Conversely, wouldn't it be appallingly embarrassing for your roommate to be mistaken for your future spouse, to have sex, to break up, and have to see each other every day, and perhaps take control of your mutual friends, too?
Of course, you're not going to tell your heart - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try to talk to your weaknesses a little bit.
At a uplifting moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good prank is a funny one, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by saving them something - never ruin someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door for them and put the keys in the water bottle, which you then shove in the freezer - but never stick their belongings on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a rough time during her pregnancy with the now seven-year-old Vítek.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone to prepare and raise her offspring.
I came to terms with the situation quite quickly - I was very much looking forward to the child and looking for positives in it.
With the uncertainty and being alone with the child, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly had the hope that we wouldn't be alone for a long time, Eva now remembers her first pregnancy.
Already at that time, she met on the internet at the chatter of the elder Vasek, with whom they began to talk about their favourite films.
Vasek even brought Eva and Vítkem home from the maternity ward, but he did not rushing too much to the role of his stepfather.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while," Eva described in the documentary series Four in That 3.
The motive for the third series of the Czech TV series is just the search for happiness at the second attempt.
She managed to care about Vítek and the financial security of the family thanks to part-time work and a big help from her mother and the help of her aunt.
Even the prospects for responsibility for a foreign child ultimately did not spoil Vasek's affection for Eva.
They finally got together around Vítkov's second birthday and he now understands Vasek as his dad and he also calls him that.
Although Vasek already has two adult daughters, he says he enjoys fatherhood at the age of 60, and he is more devoted to children.
In addition to Vítek, they were joined by two-year-old Leontýnka and eventually twins.
"Vasek came into our family sort of naturally, perhaps even by the fact that my mother never spoke to me much about her relationships," the smiling Eva thinks.
Not enough room?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born by caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of production and activity of bile acids, which are then found in the blood of the pregnancy in excess and manifest in particular by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother after childbirth usually subscriber to subside.
Emma and Ela were healthy to see Eve and Vasek's happiness, even though they were only at 36 weeks.
The emxtiece was placed in an incubator in the intermediate department, where Vasek's niece also works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after being transferred from the ICU to the room I had it with me, describes the challenging period after the birth Eva.
She spent twenty days in the maternity ward until the doctors had granted the release of the babies, who in the meantime had managed to reach the two-kilometre mark.
Waiting for the recruitment of children in Eva's maternity ward, however, was not a joy.
"I was a maddening homicorn for both husband and children," the mother of six weeks recalls of the six-times ward.
She and her husband considered signing a reversal, including because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
However, this did not happen in the end, and the doctors released Eva and the twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by T1 on Tuesday evening at 9:45 p.m.
A fairly large family can be cut back.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric two-pump and cramped conditions.
The house did not get bigger, but Vasek made Eva happy by installing the gas cooker to make the food preparation more comfortable for six people.
If it's at his best, we'll take turns taking a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive especially the family's well-being and pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or the shallowness of the cottage.
So far we've put together very nicely, better than we expected.
The mess is harder to hide in a small space and we sometimes cross the cut-out babies, but at least we are all around, smiling Eva, who can find a positive side for any situation.
Vašek's work of the lighting director for the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes hits the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
At the age of 60, he says, he physically manages family finance care and children, but how long will it be like this?
"I realize that given our age gap, it will be me who will feed this family one day," Eva admits to questioning the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted by the possibility of her own business.
With four children, I'm not a big deal for my employer.
And when it's at its worst, my husband and I can take turns taking turns on a cab, jokes a sympathetic blonde.
Apple suffered a yo-yo effect.
It's all the display.
A more powerful processor, a larger-resolution camera, a firmer chassis or a touch-sensitive display are, in the shortfor-sixty, the virtues of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The last two then also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weights of the iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
In fact, Apple's current trend was that every new generation of the iPhone was lighter than the previous one.
The only exception was the third and fourth generations, whose weight increased slightly compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram masses the difference to the inability of the novelty was really negligible.
However, this is far from the case of new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight grew by 14 grams for the smaller model, and the larger ones by a whopping 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is not surprising, last year's affair by bending in the pockets of Apple was greatly troubled by Apple.
The chassis of novelties are made of the more durable aluminium alloy 7000, which was also reflected in the weight.
But the displays have a much bigger impact on it.
In fact, Apple used 3D Touch technology in the news, which will make the displays recognize the power of touch.
To do this, the display had to be fitted with another layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the new iPhones' displays has thus increased more than double in previous generations.
For the smaller iPhone, from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, and for the larger one, from 19 to 40 grams.
For the iPhone 6s, the display is the toughest used component.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved in this novelty thanks to the escapee, which touched most of the remaining components.
The larger model is then the heaviest used element of the battery, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessor.
In this case, too, the biggest increase is noticeable for the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
The extent to which the new display technology will be practical will only become apparent when used.
The first users will be able to try this out as early as Friday, September 25, when sales of the iPhon 6s and 6s Plus will start in selected countries.
Have the flakes of champions' breakfast been in tens of thousands of years?
In Grotta Paglco, Italy, archaeologists have made a find that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of the popularity of modern man from different times, including murals, remnants of instruments, and so on and so on.
In the 23A layer, which according to the tools is dated to around 30,000 years ago but has been discovered by scientists but something that is very reminiscent of the remnants of the breakfast buffet.
There were traces of oat grains on the site, which, to be seen, apparently underwent the production process of today's popular flakes.
At that, the grains are dipped up today, then dried, rid of the packaging, the so-called pluch, then groped and spilled.
In the cave Paglickci, the grains, which appeared to have been shaped or scalded, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least the marks of use on the two stones in the cave suggest this.
So the scientists were unable to demonstrate in their publication for PNAS that there was a complete process of making flake in the cave, but the similarity was indeed very noticeable.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat the flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and quite possibly warm is, of course, quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting illustration of how intensively people used cereals long before the creation of agriculture.
Indeed, if the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes outnchlades have overtaken agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
New station reports in the Transportation Business of the City of Brno.
So I listened once again to the names of the trolleybus stops: Hnusáčkova, Ghost, Frázova, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolleybus was a bit noisier, so the report in a man's voice was somewhat less intelligible than before when the stops were reported in a woman's voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of the traffic traffic it is more discernible than a deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know, who, no one asked me, but they certainly chose that from studio recordings made in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different from the noise of the bus engine.
I have lived in Brno for quite a few decades, so I know the correct names of all the stops from memory, so I don't need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere who don't know each other in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended can be confused and can be confused and can then claim to the final, where they accidentally arrived, that the stop at which they were supposed to have stepped up was not reported at all.
Perhaps the selection of the announcer - but better again the announcer - should be made again, and this time tinged with normal traffic noise and the clatch of the engine, in which the flickering of the speaker on the bus is almost lost.
So we don't have to listen to the names of the stations of Water Heršpice, Šmírova, or then immersion in the creaking shawlina, to which I transferred in Komárov.
I suppose my old-age hearing didn't get so bad at the same time in the one day the stop's announcer changed.
I understood the reports pretty well before that day.
Good morning, comrade chief.
From the track notes.
Today, few people know what the most comprehensive background checks were during the reign of the party's biggest and the smartest.
I took the liberty of reminiscing about it.
The bus was late.
I bumped into the dispatcher's office the moment it was said from the radio that it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't collide with the comrade chief, he came in front of you a minute before you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," the dispatcher observed as I entered the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write to me that I am driving around the districts to revise the small mechanization.
It's not going to work, there's clearances today.
It's all fucked up, to the point of horror.
What is it all about?
"You'll see," the dispatcher said.
Next time you'll be.
I ran out into the corridor.
Then the warwoman's door opened and the chief appeared.
Stuffed, stony-faced, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I said respectfully, quickly on the pair of uniform's jacket buttons.
"Good morning," said the reply, and I quickly ran up to the second floor without realizing the cold, ominous tone the old maneuvered.
"You're playing," said the engineer Eva, an elderly lady to whom I respected.
She said she was even a chief before the comrades deposed her.
There are checks, and you'll arrive.
How many times have I asked what the comprehensive clearances are, but no one wants to talk about it.
They say they're once every three years, they all have to go to them, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
At least for some.
I'm afraid to see.
I pulled the file from the cliplet with the periodic reports and the phone.
"Horavcman here, come right to me," said the chief's voice.
What's bothering?
Now we met and nothing ..." I murmured, but no one answered me, each with their own thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I came at your orders," I faded, stepping into the chief's office.
The chief was sitting at the desk, looking at some paperwork.
"Comrade Mechanator," he said after a moment, without raising his head and still carefully examining the paperwork, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He dropped the paper on the table, leaned back in the back of his chair, and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, prickle gaze.
I lost my mind.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised himself for saying that in my few months in office I had worked very well and that he was very happy with me.
That the chief did very well to pull me out of the platoon at the distance.
And now this?
You realize you're a track-stage distance technician and you have to act like it.
The greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I stammered that I've used such a greeting since I was a kid, that I was raised so well, and that I didn't see anything wrong with it.
For the chief, it was like a red turkey rag.
"You are on the socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is the honour of the work," the gnawed chief snapped.
Plus, you're still knitting the name of your superiors.
One day you say "sir" and the next time you say "comrade."
But I'm not the chief to you, I'm the vice chief.
The deputies are the comrade deputies, the top trackers are comrade-in-chief's top trackers!
You'll kindly remember that!
Excuse me, sir ... Comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with a normal civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of the job or the comrade, you know, I'm not in the party...
"It's not your preference that you're not in the party," the chief said coldly, calming down a bit.
It's still going to be out of the question.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a pension prepaid for the chair upstairs.
That was not good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his preference, it didn't look good for the person.
He gave me a cloudy, prickly look, and I searched for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his condescending first name.
He was only a few years older and playing the lord, comrade a comrade.
A whooler, cocky, authoritarian, arrogant, as it was at the moment.
He was all out.
So be it, he's a chief.
In fact, not all of them, the chairman of the party organization, as all partisans, but also independents, were on the first name.
But the chief referred to many, especially those with whom he could exercise his superiority.
He's wiped me off for total bullshit right now.
I thought of something about the ass, and it took enough to overtake him to avoid it in his face.
But then I wouldn't even go back to the trek to the pickaxe, let alone keep making a railroad clerk.
What would I have made two kids do?
Plus a house in place!
I felt like crying, but I controlled myself.
I won't make him happy.
"That's all for now, you can go," the chief said, ending the audience, and began to look closely again at the paperwork he had been in hand.
At eleven-thirty, they summoned me.
Everyone in the office was already there, and to the questions about what and how, they said, right, it would be good.
Only Jozhin said bitingly, as was his custom, that they couldn't fire us all out, because the comrade chief himself would have to do the job with his loyalists, and that's not.
The word "comrade" emphasized, as if he knew what the old one had wiped me off for.
The chief's room was a pretty reunion.
Comrade chief behind his desk and at the long advisory table other comrades who were to decide on my clerical being or not being.
Kádrovák, chairman of the ROH, the staff reporter, the special-profile officer, the manner of the contour in the army, and the deputy, my boss.
And also the person most important, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the trek.
An ordinary track worker, grinding down sleepers or pitchforks threw gravel.
But also a former guard.
There were rumors that he had not been fun at the time, a pretty beast, he said.
Evil tongues said he went out in the seventh grade, didn't learn anything, he didn't know anything.
And when the crime was canceled, he ended up on a treadmill's ride.
But comrade, yeah, comrade was forged!
The chief motioned for me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an unlicensed pineconut in my throat.
Kádrovák read the opinion from the civic committee from the residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two children, and so on and so on.
So far, so good, I thought, and I was breathing a little better.
Then an opinion from the party's street organization.
He copied the opinion from the citizens' committee, perhaps the same person wrote them both.
But then it came!
Parents of the longtime party members, refused to appear before the screening committee and subsequently withdrew from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The cadre saw it and stopped reading.
The chief motioned for her to continue.
Beyond that, it was only worse.
I was a member of the SSM Municipal Committee and there I was won as the party's candidate.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me the confidence.
But I got married, and I had a wedding in addition to the national committee in the church.
I have failed the party's confidence in the worst way.
That's why I was removed from among her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even for my mother, when she died, I gave the church funeral, although she was a former member of the party.
By all this, I show a negative attitude towards the party's leading role.
When the cadre was finished, only the tapping of the chief's pencil on the tabletop interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone stared at me, and I wished I'd been far away.
In doing so, I kept repeating to myself "Communists - superhuman, communists - superhumans." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths instead?
I could repair the switches without some fucking clearance.
But now?
The career of the railroad official took her to the mark before she started.
Go back to the platoon?
I don't think that's going to work, the chief will definitely take me out for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you check out the comrade here?" the chief interrupted the tense silence with a question to the cadre.
Well, according to the report from a previous job.
You got him here?
Kádrovák was obviously not twice in the face.
On the graft of sweat, he winked nervously, as if he were himself vetted.
He nodded furiously and handed the chief some paper.
"Well," the chief said, with a hint of joviality, which often was a harbinger of a thunderstorm.
At first glance, all the praise, trained with distinction, graduated from industry, worked in the task payroll as a locksmith, the standard averaging one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essentials are missing.
Where did you get the report, comrade?" he asked again, addressing the cadre, who felt that it was somehow beginning to turn against him, and that very soon he might not even be a caddie.
This is where the comrade gave it to me, at the entrance.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the district in the platoon," the cadre babbled.
And there the assessments don't require, his was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were assigned to the technical function, this scrap of paper was enough for you," the chief said dryly.
The cadre winked nervously, and had no answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss that later," the chief concluded, and the cadre was clearly relieved.
For now, he's held it.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief asked me again.
Suddenly it comes out, that's it!
My eyes darkened, I was doused in the heat.
There was a flurry of reprimands and accusations, and I knew that I was the most despicable creature in the world who deserved the slightest mercy.
That by subtracting an incomplete report, I misled the comrade of the caddler's cadmir, not understanding why the report was incomplete when I got it from the cadre in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element that, at the time of the construction of real socialism, supports the revelry of religious obscuratory, or even participates in them.
That, that, there was a lot of what I did, or maybe I would commit, and I prayed quietly that it would be over.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care about me coming out of the position of the mechanic.
I didn't care about them taking the pickaxe.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of the comrade chief.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," the party chairman said suddenly, emphatically interrupting the chief's levitations.
The comrade here made a mistake, a tremendous mistake.
What a mistake, he's done stupid!
But he's already been given his punishment!
Don't forget that, comrade chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to the side for a while!
To reopen to him, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated guard sounded like a book.
Where did he come from?
Is he so well-read or parroted phrases from partisan training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who's to give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to make amends!
It's your party duty that no one can get rid of!
Actually, it's a partisan obligation for all of us, too.
The comrade here must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the chairman finished, no one came to a sound.
No one expected such a turnaround of the situation.
At least me.
"I completely agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the chief agreed on ice in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you had me finished, you'd hear that this is the conclusion I was headed for.
They all nodded approvingly, but you could see they didn't believe him a word.
"So I was confirmed for the role of stand-alone officer of the care of basic means," I bellowed as I returned to the office, and then I began to cry.
Good thing, apart from the engineer Eva, they were all at lunch.
She silently listened to my incoherent makeup of fresh experiences, and in the meantime I relaxed.
When I finished, she asked if I'd have coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the stove and prepared the cups.
In the meantime, she opened up about the cadre practices.
How one report, often full of praise, is in the hand of a man, and the other, in which there is every filth, is sent to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to, but on a trek at the pickaxe, and so the comrades from the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cadre?
He just cares where he would eat or drink what, and that's how it turned out the way it did.
"He'll get it from the old man," she said mischievously.
He's not going to like it today.
Beware of him anyway, he's rather vindictive.
And the party chairman?
Basically a far worse chief, no philanthropist.
Zero from the pickaxe with great power.
The coffee water boiled, and the next thing the office was filled with the smell of the just-drenched coffee.
I dropped a sugar cube into the cup and stirred the hot potion silently.
I hope I'm out of the woods.
Now I'm not fired, and the next exams are for three years.
Anyway, the comrade chief won't just forget me today.
It was published in the anthology LITERTITERTURE ON THE TRATI. in the publishing house EPIKA
The symbol of the village came to life.
The wheel of the windmill above Chlum is spinning again years later.
It can be seen from far away because it is located on a fifteen-metre-high mast.
People from a wide area call him "the airline on Chlum."
For the municipality of 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the municipality received to mark the councillors' reunion in 2010.
"We applied for a sign at the time and of course we wanted to have the fan on the emblem, everyone knows it in the area," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum Wind Pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a bit of a memento of the present: it recalls the time when the people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a rarity.
It was not until 1910, that the Chlum's representatives decided to address a solution that suited them until the mid-1980s.
In the village at the turn-off on Číchov, they had a seven-metre deep well digging.
Three years later, they supplemented the well with a metal structure with a wind pump that pumped the water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by the company Antonín Kunc from Hranice na Moravě with a cost of CZK 2,400," says the commemorative inscription on the ground-floor fence of the mast structure.
The pump, after several repairs and wind wheel crashes, served in 1971.
On 7 May 1973, a new chapter in the fight for water was written: a new water pipe began to be in Chlum that day.
The wind pump was left only with a dysfunctional municipal symbol and a rarity here.
The dominant feature was put into operation at this year's reunion of the natives.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlum decided to repair the wind wheel again and put them back into operation.
They had a replica of the original wheel made - a scaled-down half a metre in diameter.
The bike was fitted to the mast, but that same year it had to be brought down.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the appropriate material and the bike could not resist the gusts of wind.
Then the chlumian dominance rested for several years dismantled under the roof.
As of June this year, however, the bike on the tall mast is rolling again.
On the occasion of the students' reunion, the village had a replica of the bike modified and re-enapoped it to the top of the iron tower.
But the bike draws utility water from the well only into the overhead blind shoulder.
And we completely disconnected it over the summer because there was little water in the well.
It was at least empty-handed.
"In the autumn, we will then disconnect the wind wheel shaft from the pump in the suction basket again," Mayor Mašek explained.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the wind bike has entered the municipal emblem, but it is the only villages of this kind in the whole Highlands.
They have a similar element in the emblem in honour of local technical monuments, for example, in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in Vyškov, Kuželov na Hodonínsko, Partutovice na Přerovsku or in the Police on Vsetínsk.
No offense, but I don't know Lafatu, the prop for Tripoli Goian admitted.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone in my career," the 34-year-old Goian smiled at the pre-match press conference.
We were coached by Georghe Hagi at the time, it was a shame we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta now.
Except we're not going to lose this time," Goian continued.
It is this man who played 60 matches for the Romanian national team that is the key mainstay of the Greek team.
As a hitter, he will face the raids of the Spartans offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says Spartan Hybš about the Greek fight.
And he knows in part what he might be in store for him on Thursday night.
I know well Fataie, who played in Astroa, Romania, with my brother Luciano.
I saw all their fights at the time.
I know he's a very good forward, that's why he went to Sparta, Goian said.
He did not name other Prague club footballers, so the direct question came whether he also knew David Lafata, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and the Sparta captain.
Goian smiled and aimed a slightly reproachful look at the Czech journalists.
The clueless look on his face said, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of silence, he began to relish.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot of team.
He's got really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone else but Fataie.
The Spartans know that very well about Goian.
"He has experience from bigger clubs, you can say that he holds the defence of Asteras, he is kind of their organizer of the game," observed Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian has already had his best years, but he boasts a very interesting football biography.
Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City were interested in him at the time, but from Steaua he headed to the Italian Palermo, Italy, and played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We are expecting an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta are a big team, playing European Cups regularly, struggling to win the Czech league.
For me he is the favourite in this match, but we play at home and we want to kick off the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in the room with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košická, who is very much looking forward to the opponent from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering joining the Prague Stock Exchange.
Kofola should have a new headquarters in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for the purpose of trading the company's shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary objective is to have the group's headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far as the project are largely legal and administrative and have no de facto impact on what is happening in the company, says Daniel Burysh, the CFO of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the seat of the group, shareholders are considering placing the shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry to the Prague Securities Stock Exchange, the company is finalising a security prospectus, which it will present to the Czech National Bank for approval shortly.
The transfer of the holding's registered office and the related share transfers will be made in the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders involved.
As part of this operation, no shares will be offered to subscriber to the public or to new investors.
"Any offer of shares to new investors would be made - if the company and its shareholders so decide - at either 4. Q5 or 1. Q6 2016," the company said.
The firm has previously stated that a possible share offer could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of a share offering on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of shares and on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of Czech Television's objectivity in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the coverage of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time the broadcast of the main news bulletin of Czech Television.
And how did she stand?
When they teach at the Journalism Faculty about how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today's broadcast to Czech Television Události.
The migrant crisis was devoted to about 80% of the news broadcast.
Except for the first minute, when TIME reported on the riots on the Serbo-Hungarian border and called the migrant attacks on the police officers euphemistically their patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal bars), the current promigrant propaganda - judge the names of the individual stories.
Criticism of NGOs - a large space for nonprofit organisations that criticise the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - a story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Going to the Refugees - TIME consistently uses the terms by a refugee or a refugee and not a migrant.
What is striking is mainly that in the illustrative footage of the Czech Television it is consistently using only and only footage of young children and women.
At the same time, she herself said on the same broadcast that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic were men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda, which is unparalleled by communist agitators.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once rose to a block of flats, I soon stopped being the only resident.
The Formica toilet was moved into my fish.
Pets of the landlord, insects with an imperfect transformation, i.e., not a mining transition from caterpillar to beetle and a cub looks like an adult, only tiny and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me and I wasn't lying about killing them.
First by hand and later by chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some kind of blue crystals to eliminate them.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
But it eliminated them successfully.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in the same way.
A box with a kind of juvenile-seller who was brought to the nest by the ants and then he did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I digress.
As time went on, the insects became the object of my admiration, and I became increasingly inclined to think that they had the same right to life as we humans did.
In addition, I took away from my life the experience that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace another.
The truth of the fleas and bedbugs I might not hesitate to worsen karma by killing them.
At the new home, my partner and I agreed that if the fish didn't climb our necks, let them eat their renegade-skin chops in peace, some of those invisible algae, that sort of thing.
Their calm existence was disrupted by the spider.
He was a common kind of cushioner who had long resided on the ceiling.
We thought he lived on the occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only made us more comfortable.
Having lived with us for several years, we found that he was feeding mainly on fishies and that he had apparently kept their numbers in a manageable numerical state.
With a confidential regular contact with every need made, we found out that it was a female.
We have witnessed romantic courtship with a partner about a third less, carefully strumping cobwebs to the fibres of cobwebs so that he is not eaten before he reaches the desired copilations.
It took about three days, when they didn't move and didn't even respond to our checks.
Beneath the toilet bowl where the love games took place, we later found the remains of the dried-out male next to the female.
Then the spider did not move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of small spiders hanging in her neighborhood.
Soon they disappeared.
They were eaten by their mother's piece, scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she went elsewhere or off, we don't know, but after a month, two, she showed up on the ceiling again.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the toilet's ancestor.
For some time, she watched our behavior cautiously from the ceiling, moving under the toilet bowl to assess our non-aggression as a friendship.
The list of somewhat multiply-mounted fishes had decreased again, and the spider was in peace of mindful of its normal activities to provide food.
For a year, our ecosystem hasn't changed.
Our daughter, in between, came to an age when the use of the potty was already a disgrace.
We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal pouring of its contents has already been eaten away.
We urged it more and more forcefully to use the toilet.
But to maintain her bad habit, her daughter found an excuse in that spider she could see very well as wiping.
Our talk about seeing the spider was not taken at all by the luck in the house.
With a cry and a roar, she forced her potty.
No alternative.
There was a moment when the spider had to be ordered, in the interest of the daughter's developmental shift.
It's up to me.
He was captured in a glass and banished across the balcony to the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt disgusting after living together as long as I was firing a relative.
We assumed that the fish would start to appear more often and start to multiply in a geometric series.
You marvel at the world, a week, two, none of them came up.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I wondered if the spider had somehow grown there, following the example of ants, that the toilet setting was not as favorable to their existence as we had thought.
But then the first pieces of medium-sized appeared, and they were swarming again.
I had to think of a different theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I discovered that their link to the spider must have been the cause that if they didn't see it, that it was hidden in some other place and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, perhaps they had some telepathic connection to their predator, and his quick disappearance triggered some kind of alarm.
All the more so because I have no illusions about their eyesight.
They showed some light of shyness, but that they would react to waving hands or quick movements, no.
My daughter already goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten about the potty.
All that remains is to attract a spider again.
I'm already sending my wish on the air, and I hope they didn't give up on me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use the Cyclone B.
A ten commands by Albert Einstein, which enriched the world.
The statements of the brilliant scientist of the last century will probably never cease to be fascinated by mankind.
He could dig so deep into everything that the figment was always astonishing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He came to the consciousness of the people primarily with his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic affair.
It is also not to be forgotten to clarify the photoectite or the idea of quantizing the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the descriptive and the knowledge-based system of the popular theory of relativity is so convoluted to many that it prefers to opt for easy analogy for a closer introduction.
But it is not easy.
Of course, it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this, too: The hour near your lover seems a minute; a minute in a hot furnace seems to be an hour - and that's relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing from his plethora of glorious quotes to select these ten, which literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, the brilliant people try not to do them.
Only two things are endless.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not quite sure about the first one.
No amount of experiments can ever prove that I was right.
But the only one can prove at any time that I was wrong.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break up an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in the mind, then what does the empty table reflect?
I don't know what's going to fight in World War III, but in the fourth, it's the sticks and rocks.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and know much too.
If I had an hour to handle a problem on which my life would depend, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, analyzing it for 40 minutes, and 5 minutes by addressing it.
In the world, the hardest thing to understand income tax.
Finally, I can't help but not mention the Einstein formula to define success: Taking A for Success, the formula: A=X+Y+Z, where X is a job, Y rest and Z is to keep his mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are facing changes worth 1.5 billion.
"It is a success when we consider that all four of them are holding in the black all year," said the Governor Stanislav Mišák, a satisfaction.
The total profit of the regional facilities at this point is about 32 million crowns.
This is mainly due to higher reimbursements from insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
This, too, shows that, after the poor years, hospitals can finally afford to make more investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, this brings to the construction, which together will cost almost CZK 1.5 billion.
The long period when we mainly bought the appliances is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because you can't do top-quality health care without them, the plans were justified by the regional deputy health care, Lubomír Nečas.
They look forward to the changes in all hospitals.
The builders will come to the hospitals as early as next year.
In Vsetín, they are now collecting suppliers of a new internal pavilion for almost CZK 300 million.
In Kroměříž they have an extension of dialysis planned.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new internal plant for about 200 million to this year's open central pavilion.
And the Zlín Bata Hospital is awaiting the long-delayed construction of a new central reception and internment, for which it will take three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are the major and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and doctors," said Věra Prousková, director of the hospital, for example, to the construction of the Vsetín intern.
The five-story building is due to be ready in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for both internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care units.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which will be recognized significantly mainly by patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many of the sick lie in one room, have even one toilet on the floor, the beds are unplugsable, the windows are leaking and the paramedics do not have the appropriate conditions for work.
"For example, our internment was built thirty-five years ago and is now at the limit of its life," pointed out the director of the Zlín hospital, Pavel Calábek.
Within a few years, it will therefore be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected to emergency reception.
Doctors and patients will thus have all the emergency departments in one place, in addition to the new premises.
The same model already has half-finished Uherské Hradiště.
The central income is already standing, and within three years, there will be interning.
"We will pay for the construction from the loan and partly from our own funds," explained director Petr Sládek.
It is this hospital that alone can afford its own funding in the county.
Profit is still the highest, and it did not make the loss two years ago, when, for example, the Zlín hospital was struggling with a loss of almost two hundred million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase revenues and manage the costs in the whole hospital effectively," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Improvements will also be made for patients in Kroměříž Hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will go to repairs, new devices and reconstructions.
Already this year, the repair of the detention station will be ready, then the addition of dialysis will begin, or the construction of the building for the new MRI.

No one explained to me how I should keep the refugees I received in the country when they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
After talks with his European colleagues, Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains that other states are pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but reject any discussion.
He also notes that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep the allocated refugees in the Czech Republic when they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We did not receive the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be dropped from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position you came up with at the meeting of the European Union's interior and foreign ministers?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We cannot refer to migrants as sacks of salt or flour.
They're living beings who have visions, they're going somewhere, they've got some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we are able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not receive the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be dropped from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, that is, registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and saying this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
Not long ago we were dealing with forty thousand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will that be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in that territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people who cross us want to go to Germany.
Almost nobody wants to come to us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country have an ambition to us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is marginally close to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees didn't really want to come to us, but we've already pledged to take in fifteen hundred people.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept more of them this way?
We are committed to accepting 1,500 people, but with a condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border control, military operation.
Even with the 1,500, the point is that there are 1100 people to deal with with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way we've picked up.
It is a big question, and we will debate this with Europe about whether we can detain the people who are registered in Italy and Greece, or in Hungary.
Because Europe treats this in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That means they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is a deal that is not yet there, it may be that even the 1100 will not be kept on the territory of the Czech Republic and they will leave again after arriving for that Germany.
If we can detain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will deal with them the asylum procedure.
If it is the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 per cent of them are receiving international protection, according to European statistics.
They will then be given documents to allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will relocate.
This is the second project that is underway so far, and we have only made progress there in debating with the churches about the possibility of helping them to get jobs, accommodation, and so on.
But that's a very long shot.
You said that at the ministers' meeting with us the other states were not willing to discuss.
But isn't it the case that the Czech Republic is just refusing quotas, but offers no solidarity step to unblock the discussion?
And what exactly do you think the solidarity move is?
If the Federal Republic of Germany makes an incentive that all migrants from Syria can access them, the news is spreading for hours across all camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It is challenging another wave of migration that is heading to Germany, because they simply do not want to come to us.
We think the way is to protect the external borders - simply to deter the migratory waves, to help those in need, and to separate economic migrants.
Let them clearly show that they don't stand a chance.
Last year alone, fifty thousand Kosovars came to Germany.
From the safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecution service.
If we could have separated them and not accepted them or received them only according to the needs of the economies, then the fifty per cent of what social systems are making to them in vain today could go to the refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
It's now eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How far is it to get border controls to tighten up?
We were afraid of catching hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred available seats in the stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we deter will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We're doing it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who take those people from us, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - that's a completely useless story.
So where is the tipping point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days run out of our capacity to set up emergency plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene a special government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
Should the situation arise, the government can sit de facto immediately and by one resolution decide to strengthen the police on the army, say, the customs administration, or the prison service.
The extreme option is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think it can come to us this far.
Keep in mind that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarms.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, is more indicative of the Hungarians attempting to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be very marginally affected, almost not at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of the debts at the last minute.
It is trying to prevent bankruptcy.
Soccer Slavia paid for the debts.
The footballers also got their money.
Soccer Slavia stood in court for the first time on Tuesday for the insolvency proceedings.
Almost three months after it was filed with a proposal by Online Services from Pacific Samoa for around CZK 20 million.
Slavia's attorney, Zuzana Mládková, tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlová within a few hours that she should not declare her bankruptcy over Slavia.
And it must be said that she made the arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the week before last, the new owner of Slavia was the new owner of Slavia by the big Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC, as well as by Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Apparently, money from the new owners arrived at the club, at the last minute.
This is also evidenced by Slavia's comments before Tuesday's court hearing - the Vršovice club sent tens of millions of crowns to the court hearing on Monday, just the day before the court hearing.
"Everything was paid for between 9/11. and September 15," said the solicitor, Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, to the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan or the Czech midfielder Mario Liček.
Slavia also paid the fee to the agent, Alexander Losenicke.
Already on Friday, the club paid the fees due to the city district of Prague 10.
As a result, de facto, only the claims that Slavia contradicts it remains part of the insolvency dispute.
Either the club said the commitments were not made at all, or they are litigated.
However, we are prepared to pay the sums in the event of a loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in a bank account, which we can provide with an account statement," Mládková, an account statement, told the judge.
"Everything that was overdue is paid for," Mládková said, adding that unpaid or disputed liabilities are not only unpaid or contradicted.
It is also certain that the judge will not decide in the next few days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the debts in question.
Subsequently, all the evidence will be evaluated.
A decision can therefore be expected in November at the earliest.
The judge ordered the continuation of the hearing for the third of November.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but only in writing after it.
Medals for the Finns and Austrians.

The combination of cutting-edge technology, hardware and software integrated into the modular design brings benefits and a quick return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final set-up is always configured to the customer's requirements.
Any of this, from welding of structural steel to welding special alloys, as well as welding coarse materials to welding thin sheets, from appding in workshops to welding in the yards.
An incredible amount of welding curves, simple welding source settings and expandability of the welding source allows you to respond quickly to a change in requests, leading to a reduction in downtime, to the need to rebuild the resource and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with top-of-the-line welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and welding quality.
It stops wasting time and there is no waste of material or repairing faulty feuds.
There is flexibility, less downtime, more welding and higher profit.
It's this year's novelty that premiered in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We greatly appreciate these honours, as they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers boast similar systems, but thanks to the difference in software and parameter management, FastMig X is one of the world leaders.
For those interested, the delivery times, which are around three weeks, are certainly also pleasant.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts, which will definitely be expanded after the Brno trade fair.
We have been regular participants for over twenty years and our business results are almost always better after him than before it, stresses for ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, head of the Kemppi store in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final set-up is always configured to the customer's requirements.
Blanca was built in a way that didn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says the expert at the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanche went to be minted more safely, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built in such a way that there would be no drops of earth in Prague's Stromovka, according to the production director of Satra, the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovič.
He said so on Wednesday evening during a press search of the tunnel.
But it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive, he says.
It will open to the drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel was minted more safely, but the cost is rising exponentially," Butovich said.
The conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, he said, yet the country fell just a few steps from where it began to be minted with a safer and more cautious method.
"If the measures had been used 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," said Butovič.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav, Jiří Bělohlava, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the weekly Euro.
The building was to cost CZK 17 billion, according to the original intention.
Add to that the VAT, which has jumped twice in the construction period, you have twenty-one of the seventeen billion.
Add to that technology, land buyouts and engineering activities, valorization and similar items, it's 29 billion, which is not that far from the 37, Belohlav
That's what someone ordered and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone with the new Apple update
The new operating system can be requested in Settings when you click on the "General" tab and choose "Software Update".
When it is ready, your phone will offer you the option to download and then install it.
Some users faced a problem after the installation, namely the error message "the software update failed."
One solution to this problem is to wait for interest in the update to subside or to attempt it via iTunes.
The phone will guide you through the update process.
This includes the need to uninstall apps to free up space - but this will not be necessary, as Apple has reduced the update and also facilitated the process by using a special tool to design the apps to delete and reinstall the update.
Make sure your phone is charged before you start the update.

FedEx's Mixed, Reduced Fiscal Outlook for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in its full-year profit forecasts due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the land division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's stock fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings to be between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, a 20 ccent drop from the previous forecast.
Analysts had expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The downgraded outlook comes on average by 4.9 percent despite the interest rate hike, which will take effect in January. 4, and higher supplements for terrestrial transport of heavy or large parcels starting in November.
The company said it still expected profit to rise from the previous year to cut costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Board Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "published solid performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95 000 extra workers, which is about the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter, which ended in August. 31, FedEx raised $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted to be 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks were expected to be $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in the leading international shipping in recent years, causing revenues in its Express Force to stagnate.
But the online shopping boom boosted the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, ground revenues rose by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express Force recorded a higher income due to higher base rates, while profits fell in the cost store due to higher labour prices.
In pre-market trading about an hour before FedEx's shares were opened, down by $3.85 or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a drop of 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the record of 11. June.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days sitting at the 27-foot-long Honduran mahagon table this week, and will decide whether the time has come after nearly a decade to raise the key interest rate.
Rather above them at one end of the central bank's ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a U.S. mural.
The map is a reminder of Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the nation's economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: to maximize US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And that third term could be the X-factor in too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, on whether the US economy is ready to be launched at the shutdown of an unprecedented stimulus in the form of a near-zero short-term interest rate on the spot since the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows solid economic growth, recent turbulence in global financial markets could already be spooked by the Fed's cautious one to adding volatility by raising its federal fund reference rate - or any more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch in the first place," Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of the jitters in the financial markets.
About half of economists surveyed by Blomberg recently surveyed predicted a rate hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay the issue, with a key indicator of only about 30% of the chances to raise.
This would point to a downturn in the stock market if the Fed raises rates, only if politicians soften the slump by promising that there is no further increase in sight.
On Tuesday, the industrial average Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,55.
The rally was triggered by the expectation that Fed politicians would delay rates this week in peace, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would come as a surprise if the Fed raised rates now," he says.
If the Fed's politicians did this, "they'd have to go to the extreme in their program statement and hold the hands of the financial markets so they don't panic."
Other experts said that raising rates would reassure financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on the way to raising the rate of 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of the monetary conditions to confirm the strength of the US economic recovery.
Yellen said that despite spring and early summer, she expected a rate hike this year, despite complaints from the Liberals, that more economic progress was needed.
Even as job creation slowed in August, the labor market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% the previous month, the lowest at more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage profits showed signs of a lift.
And while inflation continues to run below the central bank's 2% annual target, Fed policymakers say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to struggle late last month after China devalue its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones fell to 16% below its record high in May, with investors fearing that China's slowing economy would drag down global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month, and Dow is now only losing almost 10% of the May high.
For Fed policy officials, the troubled market situation is provided by a comprehensive calculation to factor in an interest rate hike.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control of the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about the impact it's going to have on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main interests, so it should not be technically included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
A mere hint by then-President Ben S. Bernanke's 2013 that the Fed could "grab" their monetary expansion in the market, cracked down on the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but they are also consulting other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global wealth-management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "Fed has a history of overreacting to financial-market movements that appear in unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policy-making of the Federal Open Market Committee, which pushed for a rate hike, cited the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its reference rate by 0.75 percentage point over the three meetings "Despite the limited identifiable effects on US growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed the cuts.
The Fed should prioritise financial stability concerns only during a major crisis, such as the market collapse of 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Rate Committee at the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil is not even approaching this level, he said.
"Surely you do not want to be in a situation of fear of a rate rise because the markets have become upset," said Stoman, the president of the Institute for International Economics, Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinatown
The market/gate was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
It is often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinatown and not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/goods are the only contact point that offer a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, the popular Thai and Asian refreshments, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part if you need a little engine oil.
The store is massive and will take you over an hour to crawl through all the aisles.
If you're hungry for all this shopping, go for a meal in LAX-C BBQ Express.
The indoor business stand (good, inexpensive, inexpensive) is close to the registers and has various subscription points.
What's in stock: Do you need something - anything - a Thai one?
In LAX-C, you'll probably find it.
The items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in bulk.
The fresh product boundary includes special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruit and more.
The spread of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash and the fork for you, even fry it for you if you wish,
A good part of the shop is left to a massive freezer compartment where you'll find frozen kicles leaves, a bitter melon and a galley, entire ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork gut, fishballs, regional sausages, over-the-counter semi-finished products and more.
Who shops here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
Broad alleys meet shopping trolleys and forklifts.
Find out: Fresh month-to-month durian next to the cash register stand.
Where it is: The shop is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by a suburb of the Chinatown and the Centres - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own car park, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While a shop can be booked, parking is usually not hard to find.
The speed on the highways will remain the same.
Acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the House.
On selected sections of motorways it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed limit up to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
The House decided on Tuesday to agree to a Senate amendment that rejected the increase in speed.
The amendment to the Road Act will now head to the president.
President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that he would veto the law allowing the altitude of 50 kilometres.
Transport Minister Dan Ťok (for ANO) was also opposed to the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built for such speed.
Speaking to MPs on Tuesday, Ťok supported the Senate's version of the bill.
The approved amendment will now allow, in line with the government's original proposal, to increase speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, in particular four-lane roads.
The House first extended this option to highways, which could be driven at speeds of up to 150 km/h on selected sections, but the Senate refused.
The MPs have now acceded to his proposal.
The senators, with the approval of the Minister of Transport, also removed from the amendment the authorization of the traffic police to have the final say in the modification of local roads handled by the municipalities.
The Senate version, which was approved by the House, also envisages that the sewerage, water supply or public lighting cables could be stored lengthwise under the carriageway surface.
This would save municipalities on the purchase of the land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of the road vegetation along the local roads, regardless of the owner of the land in question.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to deal with towed vehicles that the owners do not subscribe to.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles that are not claimed by their owners within the six-month period after the towing notification.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight traffic through their territory on second and third-class roads under the threat of a fine for forwarding firms.
The amendment also cancels the possibility to introduce electronic vignettes instead of the existing paper ones, which will continue to be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The Ústí ex-mayor goes to trial.
He faces 10 years for overpriced welcome to the citizens.
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced project to welcome the citizens.
The police also wanted to prosecute MEP Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not extradite her.
According to the legal qualification of the case, both face up to ten years in prison.
The trial is scheduled for two October days so far.
According to the public prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused at least one million crowns of damage, the indictment shows.
The applicant relies on an expert report.
Former members of the city's management, according to the plaintiff, unlawfully made it possible to obtain the financial benefit of the company that organised the welcome of the citizens.
According to the indictment, Mandík instructed the then head of the Municipal Department of the Municipal Services, Education and Culture to address five linked companies in a selection process.
When another company entered the competition to offer the lowest price, City Hall canceled the contest.
The contract was then to be entrusted to the administrator by the city, and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded the contract by the city council.
The city paid out at least an extra million.
Both accused led by the aim of ensuring the awarding of a public contract for Darothore to organise the Welcoming of the Citizens in Ústí nad Labem for a long-term event and have acted in a coordinated manner at least in a coordinated manner with the request for the care of a proper treasurer, writes the prosecutor.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that Darothore would subsequently account for Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcoming of the Citizens' event, a price that would be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the file, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project.
The city eventually paid out only one part, roughly CZK 1.7 million, then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid out was at least one million crowns overpriced, according to the expert's report.
Mandík had previously refused any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I do not understand this fabricated case, the former mayor said earlier, noting that the city under his leadership had only followed up on a similar project from previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the Roxy II Agency handled the event.
"It was on the same terms, for the same money," Mandik added.
Criminals initially wanted to charge MEP Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the Chamber of Deputies did not extradite her for the prosecution.
Criminals have therefore postponed the case in her case, but are counting on charging Kail after her parliamentary mandate ends.
The welcome of the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
The mothers received a gift check for CZK 5,000 to buy children's supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police officers allegedly dropped a dog on the fugitive.
Then they made the press delete the footage.
Hungarian police are said to have briefly detained an AP cameraman on the border with Serbia, forcing him to delete a footage of a police dog allegedly hitting a refugee to the ground.
However, the Hungarian government is challenging this accusation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday evening when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the border with Serbia across a cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke.
Police officers intervened against the refugees, and one of them had a dog with a basket attacked by a Syrian man with a basket on his nose.
The dog of the man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," Muzi said.
The fact that Muzi was filming everything was not noticed by one of the police officers and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist was then not allowed to call either his superiors or his colleagues on the spot.
Officers took Muzi to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had to do.
Then he was ordered to delete the record.
Muzi thus lost the result of two days' work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a protest letter to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
In it, she called the behaviour of the police officers unacceptable, stating that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not having to worry about the government destroying the legally obtained material.
Kovacs, citing the police report of Muzi's account of the events, disputed.
He said the officers just wanted the reporter to show them if they were in some of the footage, which he said was the right to do.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to delete anything.
"Dogs can bark - they're trained to scare off and scare a little, but they didn't attack with certainty," Kovács says.
The unpredictable Champions League.
The win at City kicks us, Juventus believes
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of the home City.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team made many opportunities, but we had the ball on the soccer.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team had picked up a competitive match after a long 636 minutes.
It was the finalist of last season, Juventus, who was in the opposite direction before the match - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, he has only a point as the defending champion and is 2-4 with a score of up to 16th in the table.
So, too, the turnaround at the Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick in," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three cornerbacks - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal - before the new year.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Mandzukic and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is terribly important, hopefully we'll hit a winning streak," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we rank among the best teams in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the offensive phase.
This result is what my players deserve.
"Before our equaliser, we could have scored 0-2, but Gianluigi held us up," said Allegri, the goalkeeper Buffon.
"We burned some good chances," said Yayu Touré, the City midfielder.
We have to take our experience out of the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Goodbye, Angela, farewell to old Germany II.
Before we go on about the issue of immigrants, we should be aware that the whole media frenzied around here is run by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop by for a second.
Today, the newspapers and the media are full of babies who are carried on their hands by their parents on the dusty roads of the exodus.
And this evokes in a person - that is, in a European man - a sense of guilt and compassion.
Well, they're not just the desperate little kids coming in, note in the footage of the boats landing to the Greek islands that the kids can't be seen in them that they're not so visible!
Well, somehow, the pictures of the ships heading to Lampedusa, the refugees from the French border at Menton, have disappeared from our TV networks recently.
Much of the young blacks.
Also, the pictures have disappeared from Callais, where these eat and black men wait to see if they can crawl through the tunnel below the Channel.
I guess he's not moving.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans did not give a special impression on the people of Europe.
Too much of it was falsehood.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it is somehow concealed that it is not only about the unhappy children from Syria, but also about the enlivened - for the elders: fashionably dressed up - young men.
Whose musculatura looks like they've just come out of some fitness center.
There's only one personal experience.
This summer, on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus, we were lying on the private beach of the hotel.
Regardless of being private, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no hams.
And young blacks stepped out of them.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30.
They went up to the beach, all dressed in designer clothing and shoes. In your hands, of course, smartphones.
They were not interested in the private beach, and the employees - the Turks, the Muslims! - were evidently afraid of them.
They took all the deck chairs.
Whoever wasn't lying on it and was in the sea was out of luck.
They were dressed as a rapper's film.
On the heads of the cap with the nail, white and coloured adidaska on the legs.
Then they rounded the local beach bar and began to feast.
They rounded up tables, crammed to the sitting, swarthy and white bar guests - read to the Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled the dining terrace to somewhere quiet.
The newcomers drank beer from the thirds - the way they threw empty bottles around on the beach in the series from the USA?
They were always yelling loudly at each other.
It wasn't English, though.
Then they went to drink wine, also straight from the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel's swimming pool - in designer swimsuits, especially the young ladies - screaming in the water, their mothers and children and pensioners fled in horror, and half an hour later, not a single black-and-black guest was on the beach or in the pool.
They all disappeared.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel's staff were even afraid to talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a low voice that night, "Did you see the gold we were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," the waiter said.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had a 20-centimeter massive cross of gold on his neck.
And the women were a jewelry store.
"Are they drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You've seen them drink," the waiter replied.
Drugs don't wallow or use it.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I could see what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105, it was not so important to me.
I had no idea what would happen next.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they don't know.
At the time, about 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe.
And they go and go and go.
Today, the European Union's main problem has emerged, is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if the intellectuals and their associated lobbying and economically important groups have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - the now publicly recognized main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only them, the EU's and television leaders, including ours.
For example, recent TV pictures of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of images of Moscow's August 1968 television.
Sure, there were some sun-worshippers at the station, but most of all - the old-fashioned - the Muslims welcomed their fellow tribesmen.
For weeks, they babbled on the news on Czech Television, as some research said the Germans were almost all for the arrival of the emigrants.
Of course, who was only in Germany for a few days knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which is confirmed by other information.
For example, the famous public opinion research organised by ARD - Czech for the Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, just a week ago, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept even more refugees.
That was also what our TVs melvedged.
However, they concealed what the next day burst in Germany: that the poll vote on the article showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer wanted any immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the poll.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly said in November 2010, five years ago: "Our attempt at 'multi-culti's society has totally failed.'
She went on to say, "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All efforts to live together have totally failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, she says, a strategy that has allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live together without integrating has worked. They live with us here today, and we lied to ourselves for a while, that they would not stay, that one day they would disappear again.
That's not reality.
A multicultural approach where we tell ourselves that we just live happily alongside each other, this approach has failed.
He failed completely.
But even Merkel probably doesn't have the power to go up against the powerful of Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
It shows escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euroněmec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, SPD MEP, the only one who reportedly doesn't even have a high school graduation in the European Parliament - yes, that's the one Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament could play a track guard from a minute on the minute - has shown himself, as he has done more than once.
It seems, especially under the impression of the latest statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, apart from some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of countries that have been victims of Nazism are horrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who have been trying, at least externally, to deal with their terrible past of the aggressor and the murderer of millions?
Are those who say that in Germany's soul it is the devil of aggression, superiority and violence to sow?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped the efforts of the Greater Khartmans to control the entire centre of Europe?
When did he say the Grand-German idea would be destroyed by Germany?
I think he should have.
When he was shut down, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of the Greater German, which led the Germans and Europe to two wars costing millions of lives, is likely to have returned in a different form.
After the attempt by Marxists to dominate the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology, on the basis of, for example, ecology, which was, by the way, one of the main ideologues of Nazism, began to develop.
We'd say sunshine.
The German elites have long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, so they left alone all those anti-Ama fighters, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial slogan Our Forest must live.
To satisfy the restive young people who want to do something differently and better everywhere, they have fully sided with the fighters against the warm-up of the planet, stopping nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic stream in this stream, which has been a difficult verse - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after his parents' parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
Also, as the latest statements by Schulz and the German minsters openly threatening the disobedient eastern states, the idea of a leadership-led-led East, show.
Which must be listened to without question.
Otherwise, wows you!
And when we add in that that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And, as always, the capital, is behind this, especially the German one, which suits, and which is that Germany actually controls most of Europe's states through the banks and the Union.
The pseudo-spinters of the sunshine first took the Germans to the swamps of ecology and multiculturalism, and today it brought home to them and will bring in perhaps millions of Muslims.
Who, who, the voices of the sirens, will soon hit the wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see and start to rebel.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors with force again, again a part of its population - but it seems, an ever smaller part - may inflate ideologically, but in the end, as always, it will catch up with it.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim dormitories are on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the incoming Islamists erupt out?
To their aid come to the help of Muslims who have long lived in Germany, but certainly not assimilated to take over the local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalized Muslims, the incoming Islamists and the Germans, watching the Islamization of their country with fear, will do?
What will this do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when people rise up to protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-sall man by a Muslim?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict that has triggered in Europe by supporting a sunshine ideology, an elitist and essentially totalitarian ideology, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of blunt conduct against the disobedient democratic Germans and all inferior and disobedient eastern neighbors, it can't be all right.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of nosy dealers: scare them to death.
Just knock and the sturdy knocker breaks at you in a way that the weaker natures may not just stand up to.
The revived head will wipe you down and drive away and drive you away, accompanying (or rather chased away) by a persistent seller and an animated sculpture.
Perhaps it is a pity that a talking knocker cannot be purchased in reality.
Even with us, it would be useful to banish a lot of excitement and scum.
Yellow pink cheese (Oxalis corniculata).
A small weed that tolerates the dry environment.
And so he is among the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that is one of the expansionary weeds, but visually creates a nice impression of flowering.
Among the outdoor tiles is located.
It's unpredictable, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes a drier environment, is easy to adapt, modest and undemanding.
It creates leaves with a chaotic composition, but it is worth watching and taking pictures.
Below the small-football is the beauty of the detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with a purple accompaniment.
Brazilian paediatric company Rio Grande promotes healthy diet while breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric company SPRS came up with a shocking way to try to give women knowledge about the importance of a good diet while breastfeeding by pictures of children sucking from the breasts painted with the depiction of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give infants all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the overfill of energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic make of their children and protected them from tumor development.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, though Nine's is trying to take the lead on the Today Show Show
The run by Karel Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the cost of the aftermath of the liberal leadership's escape failed to produce a sufficient increase in the rating for Today.
Nine's morning show projected from the national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with host David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This distances of Aussie TV did not seem to matter so much about this tyranny of the distance, as it averaged 397,000 viewers in five capitals compared to the 330,000 viewers of the Today broadcast.
Today saw a smaller increase in its ratings compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (2833,000), but their figure was past Thursday (343,000).
Today has been filling the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, there was an average of 318,000 in the Today, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the start of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers so far and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of the change are affecting more than just parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with former star Packed to the Rafters by Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently-vastoked father who decides to move with his two children to the seaside part of New Zealand has an average of a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson could pull off a TV hit without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result gives a clear "yes."
Seven's X Factor retained a powerful 1.136 million viewers, beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (76,000) smoothly.
Seven recorded the mixed ratings of the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV quiz (from 5 p.m. to 5 p.m.), featured on Andrew O'Keefe' averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 5:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.) jumped to 633,000 spectators - enough for Eddie McGuire's small victory over the Hot Seat (63,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half an a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
Thanks to the fall of The Chase Australia's second-night standings, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dolar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor's Sam Wood is the perfect kid - but who does he choose?
The secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently found out who would win Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelor with is shrouded in insurmountable secretness.
And the three girls who remain standing will certainly not reveal who the one is the one who will receive a rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they gave us involuntary hint to who would win.
Sam Wood holds his tongue by his teeth until Thursday's final
All three women were singed in lyrically for why Wood was the perfect man, quoting his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as the reasons they would like to be his partner.
Anyway, in the question, "If not, which gets Wood's final flower?," their answers might have acted as a conductor about who would win the heart of Bachelor.
As the Jeavons-Fellows, Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one best suited to Wood, in addition to them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared a light relationship since a certain day.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched the energy of Sara and Sam, I felt that they were pretty compatible and I still think so during the course," Jeavons-Fellows says.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They are comfortable and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood could be a nice couple.
For her, she claims that during his last visits to her home, she realized that Wood might be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this isn't just a game anymore - I've opened my whole heart to him now," she adds.
I asked who Wood would choose, if not her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say it," she said.
I like both girls just as much - it's a tie between Snezen and Lana.
Bachalor airs on Wednesday at 7.30 on Ten.
Originally released as the best choice for Sarah for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to launch his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States, and a lot of teams were interviewed after his brilliant start to practice at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsl, and it seems like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, doing the Australian Rengi League's converts on the first kick-off from the pitch in Tuesday's 20-3 win at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and take him into the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also continued to be honest in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing the rookies in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.
Tomsula was also supported by Hayne publicly at a press conference after the match.
The 49ers reporter, Cam Inman, said that Hayne also received encouragement from the special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and just take care of the next game.
Already in the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne made up for his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club were hoping for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was captured swearing as he left the field after a mistake and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when a recording in his own goal area led to Queensland's three-way.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo of herself holding the Australian flag on her own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin to meet in discussion on gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested for pointed guns on the Siberian runway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts restricted.
The ÚS stood up for the emigrants who sought compensation for the property.
The pair emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, the property could not be returned, so the pair appealed to the state for damages under the Out-of-court Rehabilitation Act.
The court first awarded them the amount claimed, i.e. over 2.8 million crowns, but the appeals court changed their claim by awarding them just under CZK 90,000, citing the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
The emigrants were defended by the Supreme Court and tapped them the originally sued sum.
The Ministry of Finance, which was to pay the money, but it appealed to the CPS.
In the meantime, such a change in social and economic circumstances has been made that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at the time - although at the time the compensation was adequate in relation to the property being taken away - is now only a fractional amount of the property.
"This cannot be the detriment of the interveners as in the restitution of the persons of the entitled persons who have claimed their rights since at least 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to claim the provision of compensation earlier," explained Judge-Rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, explaining why the ÚS sided with the emigrants.
"The CPS has repeatedly spoken in favour of the general courts acting in restitution cases in such a way that any inconsistency is not interpreted to the detriment of the persons entitled and that the purpose of the restitution legislature, i.e. aton the atoèche of property grievances caused by acts of the former totalitarian state, is always to be achieved," the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studio DVA will now be portrayed by Radka Fišarová.
Radka Fišarová, incidentally, became the world's youngest Evita when, in 1998, at the age of 20, she played the role of the wife of Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech performance of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice at the Spirála Theatre in Prague.
Returning to the same role, he says, "To this day, the demanding nature of Evita has not been matched by much of a performance."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended for the role of the first lady of Argentina by Monika Absolon.
I've seen Moncha in Evita three times and it's definitely been inspirational for me.
Here I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I am quite a fan of more modern adaptations, but this one is simply particularly hilarious.
"The director of Ondřej Sokol is original, lightweight and contemporary," Fišarová says.
The notional handover of the musical scepter between the two singers will take place at Monika Absolonova's Birthday Concert on September 27 at 7 p.m. at the Studio DVA Theatre.
The evening culminates with songs from the musical Evita.
The experiences will surely include a joint duet, Don't Cry For Me Argentina (You will be your cries, Argentino!).
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol also jumps from the rehearsal table when he takes his place for the duration of the filming of Karel Roden in the role of President Perón.
Due to public interest, additional dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by the Studio DVA Theatre in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Directed by Ondřej Sokol, the main female role was originally performed by Monika Absolonová.
At her side appears as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenáčik.
The legendary songs by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovsky are performed by a live orchestra under the direction of Kryštof Mark, who was already involved in the first performance at the Spirála Theatre.
4 people killed after police fired rubber projectiles at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber projectiles into a crowd of demonstrators against a draft of the new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district officer, reports that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dhakal reports that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they resorted to the rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he says.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have clearly caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the last week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have set up a new province under the proposed new constitution and have eased their political influence.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which is demanding the creation of its own state.
As of August 10, at least 40 people were killed in violent engagements, including 11 police officers.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces - a big step towards the new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally run for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted in Kathmandu this week on the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We mustn't panic now.
After losing to the ice of championship Litvínov, you didn't even manage a home duel with the Sparta hockey players (3-5) (3-5.
Aren't you worried about a similarly disastrous entry to the extraleague a year ago?
I hope nothing like this will happen again.

NHC predicts a 60 percent probability of cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
The wide low pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a probability of 60 percent in the emergence of a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles also has a 60 percent probability in the emergence of a tropical cycloon formation in the next two days, added the Miami-based weather forecasting.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said it was launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have flooded European states fleeing war-torn and poor countries. Google will double each selected amount.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
The report was posted on her blog by Google employee Rita Masoud, based on personal experience, as a seven-year-old, fled Kabul family.
"We have travelled on many dark trains and buses and have experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoudová said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families like that are willing to help are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among the 4 nonprofit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double all the posts made via google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the biggest wave of refugees since the Second World War. Most of them come from Syria, torn by a four-year war, which has driven out 4 million people this year alone.
Many people are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be useful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say whether slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"Destrocity data takes a long time to display," Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial for a new study of JAMA surgery.
Lost operations, bariatric surgery use different methods to shrink the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was conducted on people with morbidity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
The BMI, which measures the weighted relationship in terms of height, is considered to be normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values of 25 or higher indications of an overweight person and people with a value of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a study since 2007 to study, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrektomy - in the type 3 diabetes treatment therapeutic procedures in people who were slightly obese.
The average BMI among those undergoing surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 towards the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment with diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was solved completely in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the medication-care group, it was solved completely for a comparison of diabetes in only 1 percent and in partly only about 2 percent of patients.
Furthermore, a blood pressure check, trigylcerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol was also demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers also monitored the patient's levels of haemoglobin A1c in the blood, which reflects the ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
The Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below the level of 7 percent, researchers say.
After the surgery, the average value of the A1c hemoglobin dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medication treated group, however, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glag-like check" - which is reflected in the better levels of hemoglobin A1c - has not reduced mortality at five years, according to the lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrektomy group (18.7 against 14.2 kg), achieved larger declines in BMI (7.4 against 5.11) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent against 2.1 percent) and were more likely to remise the diabetes (46.9 percent against 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, the obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent better chance of surviving in the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried multiple conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, this is a reassuring outcome for BMI people below 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This work is critical of this work because it states that surgery is safer in the group with a lower BMI," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also further argues that people and their doctors should start taking their weight really seriously after the drop in the patient's BMI between the 27 and 30s.
"I think we've been waiting too long to be showing people the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once a build-up of these genetic changes, which will firmly link their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is already a really hard one.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all the refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that a genuine solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, a study of ethics, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that under the current circumstances, humanity's interest should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable it was, was inadequate in this situation for the refugee crisis.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to address the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring about real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In dealing with the issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the George Bush actions after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that "the US's violent response has sparked a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent journey.
I know his motives were good, but he used force to create unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
A four-fold increase in the number of children who have been treated with an ambulance agent in the past 4 years
The Toxicology Center around the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children up to the age of 12 swallowed by a highly alcoholic ambulance, according to the toxicology center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylorda Lopez, director of the Georgia toxicology centre, has increased the number of sanitation products for children under the age of 12 who were reported to the poisons of the poison inspection centre from 3,236 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more often, and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink the ambulance on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or as a social media challenge.
Videos on the YouTube show teens drinking a sanitation device for cheap fuss.
The teenagers allegedly mixed the sanitation device with mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive scourge of the resource.
"Children do not think about the fact that it would hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot of more attractive (sanitation means) are those that are perfumed.
To be introduced are sanitation remedies with the smell of strawberry, grapefruit or oranges, which are very attractive for children.
The ambulance contains between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol.
In children in particular, several swigs can mean alcohol poisoning.
"This is highly concentrated alcohol," the medical director of the DAU, Dr. Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't let a glass of whiskey lounging around either, but people leave these ambulance remedies out there, and when the kids get to them, it's a quick road to alcohol consumption.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested up to four swigs of a strawberry ambulance agent at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr Chris Rithey, the emergency doctor who cared for her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah spoke the indistinct words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because of any signs of brain trauma, because the girl fell and hit her head, Ritchey says.
"It was very scary," Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been mortal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or arrange for ambulance to be out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation vehicles were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a sanitation device that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials believed the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York City planned to poison their "bad" teacher by deploying antibacterial products around the room," according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the remediation and has forbidden their presence in the room.
Police assessed the thwarted plan as "innocent chatter," and referred to the school district's discipline,
Famation: No mismatch in the Celtic team
Griffiths downplays talk of mismatch in Celtic, while Deila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he reverses it again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton is worried that the new reinforcements in January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
The first-half penalty in ADAMA's lead, with Aberdeen's narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, giving Dons a five-point lead between them and Celtic.
Griffiths denies talk of mismatch
This situation sparked rumors of mismatch in Celtic, which were denied by Griffiths, who insist that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased surveillance in the run-up to the game with the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack in Scottish title rivalry bored with the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no more rivalry between them because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently the ambassador of Ajax, states: "In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic's matches, and why?"
Because there's no more Rangers.
The people here aren't just talking about the Rangers' return.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about the two teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension at the Old Company matches and it is not only the people of Scotland who are watching these games.
I turn things back to the good, commits Deila.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was stumbling a bit, but the Norwegian boss pledged to turn things back to the good.
The defeat by Malm and the following outfielder from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now rises to the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "The Colemate has already had a bad time and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad with current events.
We're in exactly the same way - but we have to move on.
Really, we really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players much better.
Now it is very important to stay together.
Warburton is worried about the January reinforcements
Despite comments that surfaced a few weeks ago and suggested that he had already identified some of his January targets, Rangers chief Mark Warburton is worried about the big shopping for reinforcements and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former Brentford boss states: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer's."
Players who come in the summer have the whole pre-season for housing, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes there's more damage by adding useless players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Michu's transfer target hints at retirement
Forward Swansea Michu, who was associated with Celtic in the transfer window, indicated that he could retire after his contract with Swansea expired.
The 20-year-old marksman has been in trouble with a susceptible ankle for two years and has been unable to find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts to fight SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the locker room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card for that defender was later cancelled - a third red card issued by referee Collum, who was dismissed.
Neilson stands by his claim and states: "I did not question the integrity, I did not comment on the performance."
Griffiths pledged to avoid Tynecastle
The tough-headed Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting that he was singing a song with a lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the March 2015 Derby in Tynecastle in 2014
"This was a derby and it was a heated moment," the striker said, continuing: "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it is in a Celtic shirt."
The Tannadice Council believes in the management of Dundee United - Donella
Simon Donelly insists that the Dundee United board still believes in correcting the situation by the current management of the team - but admits that the decline on the pitch must come to an end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the boys for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes is happy for the 'ugly victory' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to hold desperately against Hamilton Accies to win their seventh consecutive league victory and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a penalty from the first half in Adam Rooney's serve.
McInnes states: "There is no team that has won anything, whether in cups or leagues, without winning this type of matches."
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged as UK overall unemployment rises
INDEGRIAANCONE in Scotland remains unchanged at 164 000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK has risen by 10 000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The level of Scottish unemployment was 5.9 percent above the UK rate (5.5 percent), as shown by data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over a three-month period, with the number of workers now halting to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent in the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scotland Secretary David Mundell said in a commentary on the latest figures: "The government's long-term plan has laid the groundwork for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we saw further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment was rising while unemployment fell.
Why I witnessed an execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will be watching the man's death.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in the viewing gallery in the death chamber of Oklahom State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officials witnessing his death.
I received the invitation first in January through my best friend and, although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day gets closer, I'm starting to get scared.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you of the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to monitor executions in America and, because there are often more requests than vacancies, a morbid lottery is carried out to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of posts for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will be watching the entire execution dispassionately.
I can't do that.
I will sit at the side of Richard Glosspp's closest friends, creating a special bond with him through the months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visits.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk.
The Prison Administration says I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to comment block and I won't be able to record what I'll see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way it likes, get access.
I was complaining about it.
She admitted that "she could have phrased it better," but still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the death penalty procedure.
Kim Bellware, the journalist at the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard the Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treus would have found him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there is a strong likelihood that he is innocent of the murder.
I certainly believe that sufficient evidence was not provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is wrong.
And it is from this perspective that I will follow his death.
I can't say I'm going to be really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the man I love, to die an unnecessary death.
Man escapes from Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he freed the man from the Canning River.
The bet of the man from Petrh that he would run away from the police did not work out after he got into the shallow muddy water only a metre from a policeman who tried to persuade him to return to shore.
Canning Vale police were called in an incident spanning Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and he repeated I'm not going to go out, just come for me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhttac didn't exactly want to soak his uniform, so he tried to use safer tactics and the police negotiations."
'People sometimes try to do funny things when they escape,' said Castledine.
Soccer champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, the Cousins drove the car into a ditch to avoid a bus and try to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning Ben Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the organizers tried to spy on him and threatens to end the races
Peeter Moody accused Racing organiser Victoria of trying to get a spy into the stable last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the organizer and integrity department of Racing Victoria, and was based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late-cracked chipped in maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidara's positive swab for cobalt that he could not explain.
He bit into the language about the allegations of espionage for 18 months and didn't want to make it look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it's all going to come out of you at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home today and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk up with my head and the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start thinking otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach.
I'd have to consider doing my license afterwards.
Previously, Moody launched a bomb in his race-line.com interview that the integrity of the department had tried to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with the man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him a job at my stables for finding out about the things that are being done in my stables," Moody told Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information, because they completely burned me in an attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former RVL chairman, David Moodie, current chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of this today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Will the RVL grow a few spheres and arrange for people outside of coaching positions to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them material for reflection.
But I got to a point when I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really made me sad.
I will push them and pass on the burden to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach's frustration levels have been raised with a long-term investigation into cobalt, including Lidari, and a recent scratch has made him feel like he'd "cover his license on the table for hours."
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the treatment rule on race day "ridiculous" after a clay or mud was applied to the horses' feet, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally applied mud to his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treating the cladding on the day of the race, to which the organizers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need the rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.
Cobram driver who fled was arrested
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and left after a collision.
The cyclist was flown to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the main road of Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with unstoppable accidents, failure to render assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back at rivals over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, Melbourne Storm, criticized his players' interventions as "setting a plan" by two NRLs favorite premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed the players of the Storm to "restle" his players during the controversial Storm team's victory in the Sydney Qualifying Final on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled remark to Stror after his team won the North Queensland Cowboys' final qualifying on Saturday night when he called the game a "showing" rugby league, and according to him two of Queensland's two were not "too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended the footage of his players and said they concentrated on "contact" during them.
Bellamy added that this situation has increased his confidence because his team is being criticised by two leading coaches, which may mean they are afraid of defeats by the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed any of our defensive system and techniques in the last year, the last few weeks we've only put the emphasis on contact during the procedures, and that's a turning point for us.
Trent's been here for three years and he's obviously been coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how such things always come up in this one year.
Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetov's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right about his Saturday play being as exciting as ours. It was also just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said at the time that he didn't give a damn.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that seems to him to be a cancellation, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
You would like to play such a football if you had this type of player at your disposal.
He said that view in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It gives me more confidence because they say things like that because they are worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think of us when they got to the big fights.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that more goals were scored in the Storm and Roosters game than in the Broncos and Cowboys' games.
The Broncos' game was probably good, I didn't look, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and not scoring tries interesting?
I think it's the agendas.
If they mention us, that means we will definitely meet again at the stage.
Storm are on a break this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final the next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from next morning next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets $200,000 bail for drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for holding 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled out of Queensland received bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29) was one of five men arrested last month by federal police investigating 100 kilograms of the Solay yacht drug that arrived from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted meeting the accused in the harbor during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential sentence of life for holding cocaine of commercial quality, Maksimov's lawyer set the defense on the fact that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could be in the cafe entirely by accident and innocence.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed that Maksimovic would flee.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
The mother and stepfather, Maksimovic, jointly offered bail of $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the sworn statements of both individuals, it is clear that the deposit of USD 200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts themselves were clearly inadequate because the accused did not appear further in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that she give up both the Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police on a daily basis and observe a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure paedophiles to send pictures
The paedophile used the 11-year-old girl's phone to get pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl's phone while she was asleep, then logged in to her online chat, where he had a lot of rude photos of the children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found her phone missing and then found it in her hand sleeping Hogg.
She went through it and found disturbing news before alerting her mother.
Police engaged and saw five photographs, after which analytical computers found the address and discovered "disturbed" searches on the web using terms for searching for naughty pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officers that his reason was to "take pedophiles" online before he "pretended that he was a police officer and frightened them."
Fiscalcus Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches, but he claims he only wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them in
He claims he went crazy drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When the girl found the messages on her phone, he called his mother, shivering and crying.
She saw the naughty pictures on her phone, and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and spoke of the defendant's use of her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, while residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to sue the adoption or provision of inappropriate images of children 14. June of last year, he violated the bail conditions on January 25 and did not appear at the hearing at the court on 24 March this year.
The defense attorney, Gregor Sim, asked that Hogg not be placed on the list of sex offenders because he can argue that there was "no major sexual confession" in his actions.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the ruling until October for filing a social worker report.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was kept in custody before hearing of other unresolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sex offenders before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwean's Robert Mugabe gives a bad speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, had earlier fallen on the steps leading to the stage this year.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall went viral in social media.
The opening of the parliament was also tainted by opposition legislators' claims that they had received anonymous threats to kill, warning them against the booing of Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was booed and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he reiterated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to obstruct Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that will not appear, but is named 'death'," he told the journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and as soon as they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said that the party being run by Morgan Tsvangirai was "enough" about threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is set to cut its job by as much as 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard the abolition of 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and cost savings of the company's commercial services.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies and will separate the computer and printer business from its faster-growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected job cuts will result in a change in the range of about $2.7 billion and start in the fourth quarter, HP says in a statement.
"These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive, sustainable spending structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who will head the unit after the split.
"The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP is today and will have a wide and extensive business portfolio to help businesses move to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separated company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have the company's annual revenue of more than $50 billion and "will be aimed at providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will set up a company set up in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the electrical equipment manufacturer, and whose garage in Palo Alto was dubbed the "silicon Valley family."
HP was undergoing a massive reorganization to make the move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the PC's second-largest manufacturer and one of the largest technical firms in America, is the latest in the sector based on the belief that a narrowly specialised firm has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get past injured Jack Wilsher ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilsher that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason not to play again at Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least four more English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in the next European Championships, is clearly uncertain.
The big pity of this newest problem is that Wilshere ended last season with an ankle injury in the season and then got back into his former form during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," says Wenger.
It's a wound that requires healing.
This is nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It did not concern his ankles or the injuries he had sustained earlier.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, as Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
The survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. has recorded 23 different injuries to Wilshera since he made his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has played in only 65 league games for Arsenal from a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, he was one of the two Premier League clubs to lose the most days due to injury.
Wenger is embracing the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that the improvement in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from injury, you have a vulnerable time, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition," Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will and will have a career he deserves.
Arsenal's campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur is the next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be on board.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep my balance and let the players in need breathe out," says Wenger.
Although Arsenal are the clear favourites to advance from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation for the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also not beaten in a total of 41 matches after they kept the "unbeaten" campaign last season.
The stadium shook with a 32-meter-tall Richter earthquake on Wednesday night.
That was the 10th time this year at Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that the Arsenal have learned their lesson from last season's Champions League, when they capitulated against Monaco and remain a distant chance to lead the club to their first victory in the European Cup.
"This commitment is enormous," says Wenger.
It never happened to Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have to be a realist.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about a man's friendship
The absence of such images on various shows is glaring, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever when suicides are among young men under the age of 15.
In 2013, it was the only largest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has identified 2015 as the Year of the Man, which aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help if needed.
At the heart of this fight lies the friendship for fulfilling this challenge.
A recent study by more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the victim had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of sinsincial sins belonging to friends is half the chance of occurring in mental health problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must be attainable first.
In this communication via social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, the immediate answer is often favoured over a meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more loving and more successful has doubled our need to look like it, even if we are more isolated in reality.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social condition, all at the expense of our true values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire and game-maker explained not long ago, the money really doesn't buy better luck.
The beauty of Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, who shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, the moment watching football on the comfortable chairs, Ross's lust for Rachel, all stemming from the realization that he did, men can also identify with it, even if they mostly keep their feelings to themselves.
as a Samaritan worker explained to me: ...."my role as the listener of people who feel depressed or are suicidal indeed confirming to me that even the smartest friendly interactions can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage of "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the shows that come up in my memory when I'm trying to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
He emphasises the small moments in a man's friendship.
As for my task, the state of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of desperation, but long-term support has to come from a larger near-family, from a network of friends and family.
So if you're going to FrendsFest this weekend, hosted by Comedy Central Station, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk, where the interior for the occasion of the celebration will be completely redesigned.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know the difference your friendship can make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - a full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored to help PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored on his debut in the Champions League, helping PSG to beat Sweden's Malmo team on Tuesday.
Here's the news of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a final comfortable 2-0 victory against Malma at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League and that PSG player sent the French champions to win, but then they threw away a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a head-to-head goal in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their path to the quarter-finals, which they have recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it was not the classic performance of the team of Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was martened in front of the goal and was later replaced against his home team and club, in which he began his famed career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win away or at home in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win gives our opponents a problem and look comfortable in defence is a good start, even if there are things we're going to have to improve with the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, yet I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury as one of three changes to the PSG team, which drew 2-2 at home with Bordeaux in the League this weekend, but was eclipsed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was identified as a man who would take PSG to a new level in Europe after last month's transfer from Manchester United and showed why, when he ran to the pass of Marco Verratti's defence for Malmo's defence and sent the ball behind Johan Wiland's back to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to kick-start a spectacular victory for PSG, they had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs to reach that stage, started with 9 internationals in the starting line-up and five defenders, and two overcast midfielders were a tough opponent.
But aside from a shot by Nikola Djurdjice, who narrowly missed the far corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they did not offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves struggled to benefit from the attack with poor passes and a lousy finish that was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who failed to shoot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed as his shot was slammed into the net shortly after the start of the second half by Cavani.
However, he proved more suitable when the chances for his teammates came to prepare for his teammates, and it was from his pass that Di Maria sent a shot that ended in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after the hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan header sent his sixth goal over the line this season after Ibrahimovic passed him on a pass from Maxwell's left flank.
This ended all of Malmo's thoughts about the possibility of making something of the match, and only an excellent save by Wiland from close proximity to David Luiz thwarted David Luiz's hopes and the score remained unchanged even when reliever Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal was unlocked at the end of the game.
The team's Malmo Age coach Hareide admitted that PSG were a class above his team, the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December of last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off for Paris.
For them, it was a stunning match.
Glencore made $2.5 billion in share sales
Mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, which was hit by the collapse of commodity prices, made $$2.5 billion on Wednesday from the sale of shares as part of its large-scale debt-reduction plan.
Glencore says in its statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to repay the debt.
This company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is grappling with commodity prices as China's slowdown in the economy is reducing demand and sparking destruction sparks across markets.
The issue of rights sent Glencore's share prices to the top spot in the London stock market in the early morning of the morning's business on Wednesday.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69 percent.
Glencore revealed last week that a $2.5 billion share sale is part of a broader plan to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares at 123 pence per share, marking a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They got rid of 1.3 billion shares, at a total price of 9.99 per cent per group.
Concerns about prolonging the brakes on the rise of Chinese growth have cut the price of iron ore by nearly half, and coal, with copper and other commodities plummeting by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Washington's visit to Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response from Barack Obama to visit Beijing, where the president visited in November, the report said.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his spouse, Peng Liyuan, to a state dinner to be held after the talks.
"President Xi's visit is an opportunity to strengthen relations between the US and China and urge cooperation to address the challenges of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the two states' disagreements," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet with several US technical leaders on his way to Washington and then resume to New York at the September UN meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address contentious problems, including Washington's fears about China's alleged cyberespionage and its mounting aggressiveness in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis blasted the Schengen area.
The emergency flare launched by Germany has far from bumped up the European garrison, but is already forcing the ship to change course, French daily Le Figaro reported.
The European Union decided on Monday to tackle the problem of refugees first: it will systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they set foot on the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than arguing about the future distribution of refugees under quotas based on the quantity, which is increasingly moving away from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the Member States made the priority.
Before taking care of the final destination of the refugees, it is first necessary to filter out those who are arriving today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential to manage migration," the text discussed by the ministers in Brussels stresses in a text discussed in Brussels on Monday.
Following the crisis of the common currency, the EU is at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it is not losing its resolve and increases pressure.
It is renewing border controls, particularly with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in the country.
The central power is making it clear that without it, no free movement is possible in Europe.
It has already been used as evidence that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering it, albeit with varying degrees of intensity.
Hungary did this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under the Schengen rules.
That it is a domino effect, but also seen blind.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is being made up last.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of the newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified by taking out their fingerprints.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory because it is more afraid than others to keep the camps on its shoulders in which the refugees would accumulate on its behalf.
Greece remains a real black hole.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as have arrived in Italy recently.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial disruption and awaiting a new government, has folded its hands in its lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan route and the source of the now common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises that the introduction of the checkpoints will take place as soon as possible, but it has not given any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece are related to the whole of Europe," the EU's interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on the front.
It is therefore a question of deploying the intervention teams of the European Border Control Agency in this country, Frontex.
The EU wants to help Greece to expand its reception capacity for asylum-seekers and strengthen the surveillance of the islands.
"Afghteal financial resources will be needed," the text submitted to the ministers for approval warrants warns.
In terms of law, Athens will continue to have the last word.
The question of the emergence of real European border guards has not been formally raised, but Europe is coming closer.
The 28's new emergency situation, it has, as well as, pushed to the second rail for the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was raised by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament earlier in the year, strongly supported strongly by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained on Monday in a text approved by the majority of the 28.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm pledge includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, as already reached in June during the hectic EU summit, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alpine, including three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
German nationalities, according to the authorities, are also the woman who survived the only one of the affected eight-member group.
Previous media reports indicated that it was Polish.
A woman in her 30s was hospitalized in the city of Briancon with serious leg injuries to her femur.
The dead were made up of mostly 40-year-olds, according to AFP.
"The rescue service is over, the bodies of the victims were also taken to Briancon for identification," said the Prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department, Pierre Besnard.
The accident happened around noon in the mountainous Pelvoux mountain area below the top of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins mountain measuring 4015 metres.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
The eight-member group, according to him, was pouring in a huge amount of snow at an altitude of about 3900 meters.
The weather service did not warn in the area today before the inclement weather.
Trengove before the Braga match: Finally, the true Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, in his Championship opener in the cups, managed to make it through the European league's pre-season rounds to the group stage with Liberec and is now looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
The Slovan will welcome the 2011 finalist Braga to the start of the main stage of the competition and, according to the coach, wants to impose his playing style on her.
After all the nerves in the knockout stages, when every goal and every situation could knock you out on the way to the dream group, now we're there and we're going to play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal we've scored, we can play our tactics and we're not bound by a double.
"I am very much looking forward to it and it is a true Europe, before it was only a qualification," Trpišovský said at a press conference.
Braga is considered the top team.
They will be very active, with all the Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The opponent may be more difficult just to have a name for not having such a name, but at the same time he has a player in his cadre who, I suspect, scored three goals for Manchester.
"It's an excellent team-level team," Trpišovský said.
He does not consider Braga to be the clear favourite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not the outsiders.
"I think we showed in the domestic competition and in the preliminary rounds that we are strong in our stadium and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen from 11 duels this season.
He believes that Liberec can impose its style on Braga.
We are going to have a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time it is uncharacteristically disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 set-up with a quick transition to the offensive phase.
"He is a very difficult opponent, we have discovered the weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the pitch," Trpišovský said.
We studied our opponents a lot in the pre-season, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, to which we adapted the training sessions.
"And we definitely want to, although it will be very challenging to be played according to our notes," the coach added.
Student films will take over Písek, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries have entered their works this year for the 15th edition of the International Festival of Student Films in Písek.
Four dozen of them, which were sent to the final by a committee of students and educators, will be projected from 15 to 18/18 onwards. October at the Portych cinema.
The best of these will be chosen by an international jury, said festival spokesman Jakub Charvát.
Each year the festival has its own special theme, which is based on the festival theme song.
This year, it's a detective story.
The director of this year's gala evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatrical.
"And of course we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our trailer this year," said Charvát.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of the student's work - films of fiction, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, which will include last year's winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the festival organizers prepare an accompanying programme.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turbošansonová group Poletíme?, playful band Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with the recital Life at the Bar.
The festival will also host two exhibitions of photographs.
The first will be brought by a graduate of the Sand Film School and a recipient of the prestigious awards, including the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ašenbrennerová.
The second exhibition will bring to light the atmosphere in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The cinematographer and documentary filmmaker Martin Čech will come to the sit-down with the visitors, the silent film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber and the sandhouses Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of the sculptor Jan Novotný christen their new book 3 by friends from the city of P.
This year we will also remember Miroslav Ondříček, the patron saint of FAMO in Písek, who left us recently.
Our school and the festival are his legacy that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to gather here, exchange experiences with each other and develop joint ties and film crafts," the spokesman said.
The Pitching forum, where students can meet film professionals, will certainly help to do this, complete several job-suits at the same time and get a job.
The festival is associated with the creation of the Private Higher School of Film in Písek.
Its founders, husband and wife Vladan and Miloň Terčovi, organised their first year in 1997.
By the sixth year it was held once every two years.
In the event of the bankruptcy of the TA, insurance companies are to cover the claims of clients in full.
Insurance companies should cover the full amount of claims for the travel agency's bankruptcy.
This was decided by the House on Wednesday when it approved a modified amendment to the Tourism Business Terms and Conditions Act.
Travel agencies will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee, according to the draft, which is headed for consideration by the Senate.
Insurance companies with the obligation to pay for claims of clients even above the agreed limit do not agree.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the adjustment, arguing consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end the insurance of travel agencies against the crash if the amendment applies.
But the proposal has also been criticised by travel agents.
Without insurance, they will either have to quit or go abroad.
Minister for Regional Development Karla Šlechtová (for ANO) pointed out that the cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation were not Eurocomform.
She drew attention to this year's Constitutional Court ruling, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund, regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, Šlechtová stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have a limit to be feasible," said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek.
The bank guarantee, according to him, will not work because no one will give it unlimited.
"Travel offices will have to cease or move their activities abroad," Kalousek warned.
A member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies, Tomio Okamura (SPD), disagreed with Kalousek's concerns based on a survey of member CK.
"Stop showing us lobbying insurance companies," he said.
The insurers’ observations are not considered relevant by Okamura, there is no official written statement of which in that sense exists.
But they are said to be looking into whether the travel agencies will take part-time, which Okamura says is not a problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the competing Association of Travel Office of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who talked about deleting the stairs to Czech travel agencies, also warned against the provision.
Travel agencies, according to Fischer, will not be able to take out insurance.
"Consumer protection is working," Fischer says.
Her proposal to launch the contentious passage was not approved by the House.
Nor did Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) come to the request to return the draft to the committee because of an alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Filip drew attention to the travel agencies, which he said could threaten consumers.
The rapporteur of the draft, Martina Berdych (ANO), has withdrawn her proposal in the light of the Constitutional Court's verdict to limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not have known that the insurance benefit would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum four-million-dollar insurance limit for travel agencies that offer airline tours and a million-dollar limit for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The threshold will remain at 30 percent of the planned sales of the trip.
However, the insurance benefit limit will have to be such that it covers all customer claims in the event of a traveler's bankruptcy.
The standard, even after the modifications, stipulates that travel agencies will have to newly mention for the sold tours, which travel agency is organising.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies before the conclusion of the contract, among other things, data on the management and number of tours.
The approved amendment to the Public Administration Committee also envisages further regular information on insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to supply them with details of the number of passengers and tours sold each month, the total price of the tours sold and the amount of advances and sales for the trips and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agent has failed to fulfil one of the legal obligations to the insurance company, it will call for a remedy, or be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts if the breach of duty could jeopardise the interests of customers.
The amendment is also to be re-aligned to the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the grant to the mountain service at the basis of its application, which it will always submit until the end of April for the next year.
The request will include a report on the use of state money last year, a financing plan of expenditure and an outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, the bill's drawer, however, did not think the situation of what would happen if the insurance company terminates the CK's contract.
It will not be allowed to organize the tours and clients who purchased the trip before the insurance is terminated, so they will lose it, according to the association.
The TA in such a case will suffer a significant loss and may also go bankrupt, even though its management was in good shape.
One of the ways in which travel agents can cope with such a situation will be to sue for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad, and we will only act as agencies in our market, said the association's vice-chairman, the association's vice-chairman.
The draft amendment also includes the institute of a bank guarantee, but so ill-considered that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, as the bank guarantee cannot sound at an unbounded amount.
Moreover, according to the association, the change in past practice is de facto unnecessary.
In a two-year horizon, the whole law will have to be recast again, given the new EU directive.
There are now a total of 942 active insured travel agencies operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three CKs have ceased their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell trips worth around CZK 20 billion annually.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with the German provincial prime ministers.
At the same time, it again appealed for the distribution of refugees who had already arrived in the EU among the members of the 28-year-old.
We must do more to help the countries from which the refugees leave, or in which they are staying after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will work to do on decent conditions in refugee camps, such as in Jordan and Lebanon, the German chancellor said, according to which such a signal could also be higher financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU's international humanitarian organisations.
"Federal countries are also supporting the German government to promote a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to European countries," Merkel said.
In this context, the country's prime minister of Brandenburg, Dietmar Woidke, said at a press conference that he expected real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among others.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke in favour of speeding up the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible whether they have a chance to stay here.
It is also needed for the authorities to start integrating foreigners more quickly, the Prime Minister of Brandenburg said.
According to him, the majority of the money that Germany spends on the care of refugees should also be used to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
It will take more teachers to make the refugees manage German.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the refugees can be integrated, they can become an asset to us, he said.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in film
Matt Damon confronted the Afroameter filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, claiming that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During Sunday's episode of HBO's Greenlight project, the actor, booked in the series, interrupted the Brown series, emphasizing the need for alternative views about the black protagonists in the script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting a movie and not when casting a show," Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted with indignation of disbelief and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments about the Martian got on the air.
Damon and Brown teamed up with joint well-known producer Ben Affleck and brothers Farrell to discuss the show's finalists.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they will treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at the outset.
The only black character that is a hooker who's covered in a white pimp.
The producer of Drama the White People championed the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted that their directing "would eventually give us something we didn't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disapproval of Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at writing the clip, "Matt Damon interrupted the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SOWHERE, that it hurts."
The tweet has garnered more than 5,000 retwebs and 4000 liks since it was released.
Damon's comment comes at a moment when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After being killed by teenage Michael Brown's white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took a national effect and pushed the creators of the laws and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colorful people.
In February, the singer Prince made allusions to the movement, while presenting the nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Alba is still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
Most recently, the leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to a question from Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the supervisor said.
Damon was recently reported to a list of entertainers, producers and media of moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the west.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
‘American Ninja Warrior has the first winner’
The professional mountaineer and baron maker Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday to take home one million dollars.
In the competition, which had just finished its seventh season, none of the contestants had managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the final of this season, the two men made it through to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last hurdle was a 30-second climb for a more than 220 m long rope.
Britten graduated first in the upright limit, becoming the first contestant to surpass the draining 4 stretch in the American Ninja Warrior, however, Caldiero beat him by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview for the news! News right after his hard-earned victory and it was clear that he was still in shock at the $1 million prize winnings.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac E! said in response to his winnings.
"So suddenly . . . I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview with The Hollywood Reporter about the run-in and why Britten would not receive any reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to complete the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the one who completes the track the fastest.
"If more competitors take part in the track, the best time will win the prize," said Weed.
Even if winning the main prize would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
"I don't think he's in forge.
He's glad he's managed to get what he's accomplished.
He received a warm welcome from fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife."
Geoff told me, "If there was someone who could have beaten me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I had won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers only passed just past the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the tigers from Detroit, the second half of the season was not a walk in the park.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are now in the last of the central division of the American League.
They narrowly averted their defeat by the Tigers, beating Minessot a narrow 5-4 result at Target Field in Tuesday's game.
The twins missed the chance to get closer to the Houston Astros team and captivate the second wildcard in the American League.
Even for one night, for Detroit, it was the return of the speech to Z, which was so elusive to them during the second half of the season.
"Winning is always fun, and it doesn't matter how you do," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his offensive standings and Detroit scored three times in the first two inning, then took another in the sixth and ninth inning.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 of hits and 3 runs.
It was only his third consecutive play in his last nine games.
"I want to finish the results this year," Simon said.
"It's hard to get into a match when you're often on the bench and that's why I want to get really into the game."
Tigers' batter Victor Martinez scored three shots and made 2 runs and his first drawn point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point game since the last game in June, scoring four times in a game against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned into it," Ausmus said.
"He looked good at practice, batted noticeably better, and managed to bring it into the match."
With three circles at the end of the seventh inning, the Twin Towers won the best shot to return to the game.
The centre-running fielder Byron Buxton took the swap thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
Right-handler Aaron Hicks scored a point with a set-up bat, and Simon chased out Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy knocked out his only opponent, Mauer, and he had the baton of Miguel San in front of him, who hit the ball and ran two bases, leaving right-handed Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on the scores and a second-inning chance to draw in the second inning, VerHagen managed to send the third-seeded meth to over two bases.
Plouffe has already won 27 runs through two bases this season and is in the league table.
Detroit held the ninth inning, Mauer scored two pulled-down points, and Bruce Rondon gave a score of 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-handed man knocked out Sana at three odds.
Detroit took the advantage to score points on Phil Hughes' game.
The Tigers gained three orbits in the first two shifts against a retired right-handed man who came into the game after a break for more than a month's break due to a back muscle inflammation.
"I certainly didn't envision such a start," Hughes said, "but I already felt during my third shift that I was doing better to pitch."
After resisting the onslaught in the first inning, Hughes let one point in the second to the countermaster Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right-hand laureate J.D. Martinez was carried out by Victor Martinez, who first ran all the bases.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 streak.
Third-ranked Nick Castellanos followed him with a point to the right side of the field and scored with another round, but Victor Martinez was sucked in the third straight.
The Tigers added a second-inning when pitcher James McCann and fielder Anthony Gose got two and, in turn, one point, and the resulting score was on the resulting score of 3-0.
"That got us to the knees," said the Twin Manager Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won the pitch count, finished scoreless inning in the third inning and was replaced by right-hander A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran off three bases, scoring six hits and 4 strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the Tigers' right pitcher, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list thanks to his stretched muscles in the shoulder since mid-August, is expected to start in Wednesday's game.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who will return from injury and take on the Twin Towers.
From 30. June, when Norris was traded for left-handed pitcher David Price, he scores 1-1 after 4 games.
However, he has not yet played since August 20 because of a stretched muscle.
The Tigers and the Twin Towers will play their third match at Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will be challenged by Minnesota's left-player Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open up the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, whose task is Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," the central group's head of the Deepening the Over-Replant Reform said regarding the 16th meeting.
Promoting the opening up at the emerging reforms will give new impetus and vitality, and will also provide a new space for economic growth, says Xi.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory market access, the loosening of the border control policy, support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and reorganisation of the SG&D system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up to identify sectors and businesses that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is significant as it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensure the business environment and make the market more open, the statement says.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to firms and make sure that the firms themselves decide how to run their business.
The statement also states that China will allow the border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies that are funded from abroad and will provide them with better services," the statement reads.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card" by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process.
Provision of the rights of attorneys to practise and develop by professional judges and the prosecutor was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Lecturers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary Region, new bed wards may be created.
According to the Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region, Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current capacity of the bed wards of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial modifications should be made on the basis of an agreement between departments of individual hospitals.
In the region, however, there are also possibilities of expanding care.
For example, in the surgical department departments, there could be centers of one-day surgery, where surgical procedures would be performed according to the set concept, which do not require more than 24 hours of hospitalization.
In which specific hospitals the workplaces focused on one-day surgery should be, is not yet clear.
The skin department of the Karlovy Vary Hospital could in turn create a laser centre with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalic center to take care of patients with a natural brain disease who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and be an integral part of the anaesthetic-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the Ostrov hospital, where such care already exists.
Another bed capacity that appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region is the aftercare bed and especially the bedbeds of the Long-Term Patients Treatment (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and, above all, should closely connect to acute care beds.
Part of this facility should function as rehabilitation beds and part such as classic LDN beds, the concept recommends.
As he points out, the aftercare beds are mainly absent from the hospital in Karlovy Vary.
There, they could be used by the abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary Region, there are no social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
These beds are in short supply throughout the country, so it could also serve for other regions as the so-called Alzheimercentrum.
Hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-on beds, according to the recommendations, for which European subsidies will be mobilised.
"These are beds that will follow up on the subjects of supespecialised care and will form a space for the translation of patients after the procedure, for example, after the procedure, for example, after cardiac surgery, neurosurgical, transplantation or other procedure," the regional concept of inpatient care describes.
New services could also be offered in the area of psychiatric care.

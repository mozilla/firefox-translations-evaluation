On a distress call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend
While calling the emergency line with a shreek-turned voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to come to their home.
Lamb has set out to say that his "sweet little dog" was alive and probably upset by the house, and that contacts to the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the police, the body was found by Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy, and she is the only one who ever loved me," the letter, according to the authorities, was signed by Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to the school campus where police believe he shot the favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at his office door.
The chief of police at Delta State University, Lynn Buford, said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb is said to have made a fatal call to the emergency line shortly afterwards.
In the end, another death came; Lamb had taken his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school was shot, it forced the students and the faculty to hide behind the locked doors, the commissioned authorities still trying to see what Lamb's motivation was.
The details released by the state-side investigators, as well as the students and staff who knew it, together created an image of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or a violent history.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote in thanks to the "great people" with whom he shared an academic life.
The two taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other faculty members, and many students took courses at both sides at the same time.
At the same time, inclinations have been inclinations in terms of problems.
The student who was praising Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaky, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him that he was facing stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave for health reasons, when he said he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to recruit university staff meant that a doctorate on which Lamb worked hard would not have given him an automatic term to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew of no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lambo was probably troubled by something."
These questions will no longer be answered to us.
After leaving the campus, police picked up his trail as he crossed the border of the state of Arkansas back to Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single pistol shot in the yard of the house about a mile from his parents in the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed to the coroner of Washington State, Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb had gone to this house, though Johnson had said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this region.
Lamb began working at the University, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has a population of about 1,2000, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamba's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic, funny, funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through their mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was the great older guy who tutored her guitar to play for several years.
He was quite a heartbreaker at the time.
The heart of all the girls appeanely as soon as it appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and living in the outskirts of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for a while.
During the emergency phone call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely slumped," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when he and Abigail tracked down at the summer festival three years ago.
They later played random gigs together.
O'Steen said that his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, the bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a scant-lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lambo and Prentiss on the night of September 5, the sweat Lamb had finished guitar and harmonica for a disenfranchised crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"They've just been a happy couple," he said.
We laškoved and recorded each other on a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the slain professor, ran the first-year seminar and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the Boys' Student Club and the reign of students.
At the Cleveland Delta State campus on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and community members, attended a candle-sighting commemorating event.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother, Jeff Schnidt, also attended a vigie during which the university choir sings "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday the school began again.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is over.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
The Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story was edited to reflect the fact that police now claim that Lamb made a call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually canvassed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us claims to have not to be the asseer of seasonal workers as they did last year, but the child toy and product manufacturers say they will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it planned to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, a drop from 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will start recruiting the bidders this month, and will recruit staff during October until December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to help out at stores and sales, for the dispatch and delivery of the goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'rande' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to come in when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in time."
The film begins and I realize I'm within reach of what you might call a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Retime in time," is a documentary about "Retelling to the Future," which states interviews with Fox, Leo Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It is, indeed, the best travel document for me that has ever been filmed."
"Runback Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that there is "no military solution" to the conflict of nearly five years, and more weapons will only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support for inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and among the Syrian people and regional powers "misour have made this situation unsolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they showed in reaching the Iranian nuclear deal in dealing with the crisis in Syria.
8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to label him as a man who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands over like a fleddless joke.
And some are preparing for the implosion.
But whichese Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they are failing (yet).
10 of the last 11 national polls show that Donald Trump is in charge for a double-digit number, and some people are beginning to seriously ask what this real estate magnate's nomination chances means.
Of course, it is yet the start of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, the leadership of Rick Perry made the path of Herman Caine's rise, and in the end neither of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could run into general elections.
But outside groups like the Jeba Bush Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and are beginning to unload their dollars on the task of overthrowing him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that a real estate mogul is not just a postseer phase:
Trump's ratings for favorability were reversed by 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University vote showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are holding up at the start.
After the Quinnipiac University vote last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enifty" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "spent in" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "above" against 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "unsatisfied" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush became the candidate.
Most Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pomposity and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationwide in favor of the idea that a real estate mogul has the right temperament for the presidency, according to a ABC News/Washington Post vote on Monday.
The same number is held in the Iowa State senatorial club, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think they have a commander's personality, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have a personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn't belong in the White House, according to the ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When he puts on his scholar's hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
Asked who would most likely win the GOP nomination, four of the 10 said that Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is a change in late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full publication: GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
At the time of the previous cycle, 4 of the 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry as the winner of the candidacy against 28 percent for Mitt Romney's eventual nomination.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Even when Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump is still beating almost everyone.
Some scholars point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trumpov support is diffusely disseminated among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct contest between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always get majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally by Randal Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christio by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead over the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
A bald majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've already made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters supporting Trump say they will not change their minds.
It's obvious that a lot of things can change that, and no one can really say that they would never change their minds.
46 percent say they keep their back door open for a change between the candidates.
Still, Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider associate neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion to be final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 of the 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called Mexico's immigrants "the rapists" in his campaign's announcement speech, immigration is still sticking to the main and central theme of the 2016 conversation.
Some fear that Trump's pomposity will lispyt key Hispanic voters from the Republican party and damage the pursuit of rebranding.
But according to a new ABC/Post Monday poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain, too.
Frustration from the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now receiving about half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their state of outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post vote on Monday say they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg vote in Iowa revealed a few weeks ago that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent were "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "herically angry."
The House supported a larger share of the state's coal fees.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
At first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of the fee for the on-board of brown coal mining from the mining company.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised MPs that both the state treasury and the budgets of the municipalities would receive extra money as a result.
The draft was criticized by opposition MPs, who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act at first reading, which means, among other things, that the state should receive a larger part of the revenue from the mining company's fees from the mining company's mining fees.
The state's share will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will be reduced from 75 percent to 33 percent so far.
The draft also changes the way the remuneration for the minerals that companies extract.
The change in mineral extraction fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state coffers than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of municipal budgets are to be neutral as the fee is to be higher.
In the year before last, municipalities received roughly CZK 450 million of the fees and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal was worth about 200 million crowns to the municipalities and the state to 66 million crowns.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the reimbursement from the extraction of the premises with the allowed mining to CZK 1,000 per hectare per year.
The revenue from these reimbursements is to continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that this would gain municipalities annually instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The recovery is newly calculated as the product of the amount of the extracted mineral and the rate for each mineral species.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda, however, warned against the fact that the setting of the fee by decree by government decree might not be in line with the constitution.
According to the Minister Mládek, however, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral, which is state property.
Fees are received only by municipalities whose territories are affected by the mining.
In the case of deep-sea coal, three-quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter of the state will receive.
The same ratio will be for the extraction of radioactive rock.
Some of the money the state collects in the mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after the extraction or to provide the Mining Rescue Service.
The draft was criticised by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that they would damage the municipalities affected by the mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to have the Minister of Finance improve his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) chosen in the Ústí nad Labem Region.
Ahead of the rise in unemployment in Most, KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kucera wanted to return the bill to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining firms, the fee increase will not be made to the price of coal, as prices are more than 90 percent contracted in the long term.
So major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in reimbursements by seeking to reduce their operating expenses, which would mean a reduction in the number of employees in the first place," the government admits.
However, it says, the increase in fees is acceptable in terms of employment.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment to Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining, before the law is approved.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have repercussions for revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with the Met that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak Army should not be made until after 2020.
The limits at the CSA mine should be broken for social, economic reasons, and because of the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Veselý will lead the Czechs as the number one, the deployment will be affected by the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the board at Thursday's draw for the Davis Cup draw in India, and this time each of them is likely to hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil plans to break down the load over the entire quartet, due to the difficult conditions.
Delhi is hot and high humidity, so challenging matches are expected to stretch to five sets.
We have to take this into account.
I'd like to spread it out according to the weather.
And depending on how it will look, said Navratil during today's Czech selection training at the centre of Raj Kumar Khánna.
With the team's number one and the world's 40-year-old Jiri Vesely, the team counts for both Friday and Sunday's singles.
The position of number two is likely to be Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek.
I'd like almost everyone to get involved.
It's slow in my head, but I'm not saying it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech line-up should be Štěpánka's participation in Saturday's doubles.
It's just a question of who will stand next to an experienced doubles doubles player who has a record of 18-4 in the Davis Cup.
It's probably not going to be cheerful.
There are options with Rosol or Adam Pavlasek.
"I really don't know with whom and what it's going to look like," said Navratil.
It will be decided according to the development of the doubles.
Pavlasek may be a variant, with Vesely surprised in the first round with a win in the doubles over the Australians.
"He is decent for the doubles," said Navratil.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to perform the same way I've shown there since the second set.
"I am happy for the experience and I would like to bring a point," Pavlásek said.
The home side will deploy Yuki Bhambri (15th in the ATP rankings) in the doubles, having won the Shanghai Challenger last week, beating the third and fourth-ranked players.
The number two will be Somdev Devvarman (164.).
They are both challenger players and our guys have experience in the ATP Tour, but we have convinced ourselves many times that the Davis Cup rankings are not decisive.
"It's the current form, the weather," said Navratil.
Friday's opening singles will begin at 6:30 GMT and can stretch out because of the weather.
The forecast is to rain and the court is not under the roof.
However, the game can be played under artificial lighting.
They've already igumed, and it's got some like two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be put to be played under the lights," said Navratil.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut in the PMQ is highly anticipated
The new working manager, Jeremy Corbyn, will make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and will work with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six secondmented questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be closely examined by the media and the MPs.
In a week-long statement, he asked for "fewer theatres and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip several sessions he would leave behind to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC's annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to become quietly during the singing of the national anthem in service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of attention on several stories on the front pages of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he would be "flight in a respectful silence" and that he would acknowledge "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he would recommend to the Labour national anthem to sing "no no a matter of view" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn's top team, quoting differences in the economy, defense, and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a leader.
The BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, says that the political differences in work are also "admerged" after the appointment of Mr. Corbyn through his position in the European Union and the government's benefit limit.
Mr. Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had put forward amended proposals to remove the entire idea of the benefit limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of shadow work and pensions, said that the party had "very clearly" opted for the government's plans to reduce the limit from £226 to £2233,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers' Party, faced by David Cameron in the last decade since his election as Conservative leader.
The labor-party leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has "from the crowd" ideas to questions for Mr Cameron and have received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that the PMQ is too confrontational and that they will refrain from both "shot responses" and toothless commerce, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn argues that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at the PMQ when he does not attend-such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also abandoned the idea of letting other colleagues get out for him from time to time, because he had been told that he had discussed the matter with House spokesman John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" policy style, which was often associated with the PMQ but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of the leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House and their position among other MPs, even though critics have argued that they have become a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Focal in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
But a group of former street kids found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhoods and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound rises as pay rise in the UK accelerates
The pound jumped in the following data and showed the recovery of Britain's wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was conducted above with the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and June, GB profits, including bonuses, rose 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009 and it looked like the estimates of when rates would rise were approaching.
Sterling was climbing more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro at €11.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped by 20% after receiving an approach to the bids from his rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and an approach to brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's stock was 0.9% higher after encouraging news from rivals to the luxury merchandise Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose by 5% after the mining giant said they rose by $2.5bn through shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
The shares in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest drop in the index and fell by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs downgraded his rating to the company for "sale."
JD Sports up 3.1% after sports company announced an 83% jump in mid-year profits in pre-tax profits of £46.6m
JD Sports chief says higher wages could hurt expansion
Executive Chairman of the JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power will outweigh the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could be hit by plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of Prague's apartment building marshmallows cheers.
The controversial structure got a stop sign.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
The construction, which is to be created in close proximity to the Agnes Monastery in the centre of Prague, was protested by 1 hundred people in front of the Prague office, and a petition was also created.
The magistrate stated in the decision that the building code had been violated because not all the requirements of the zoning decision had been respected.
"The zoning decision in question does not contain certain elements, such as the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, the sufficiently clearly and comprehensibly described the shape of the building, the delimitation of the territory affected by the construction," its decision reads.
The Municipality also considers it illegal to consider that some of the documents for the decision were issued for the documentation initially under discussion, but which has changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be built on the National Gallery's land, but the investor does not have its valid approval.
The dossier shows that, however, the landowner thus only demonstrated the consent to the project documentation for the zoning management, not the consent to the placement of the construction on his land, writes the Building Regulations Department.
According to Francesco Augustus Razett of the investor company, the Building Regulations Department noted the decision of the superior body - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the deadline for initiating the review had already expired.
In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, abide by all the laws of the Czech Republic and respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people dubbed the marshumum because of the coate's proposed color, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
In the city centre, hundreds of people have gathered in protest against the construction in the past.
Associations and residents of nearby houses resent the fact that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inappropriateness of the building for the historical centre of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Agnes Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original design of the 2008 project, which envisaged a glass facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NPÚ) and revoked the permission of Prague's monuments in 2010.
However, the new project by Praga Progetti e Investimenti with face-shaped windows was approved by the NPÚ and the Municipal Monuments and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the opponents' complaints, saying he never counted on the façade in pink, which gave the project the nickname after the pink and white-and-white confectionery.
The Czech politician gave the migrants a ride.
The Hungarians put him and them in jail.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
On the way, he and the crew took three Syrian refugees to the car, who he said they wanted to climb about half a kilometer.
It was not yet criminal in Hungary, he said, he told Lidové noviny.
We knew that law enforcement did not underdo such conduct.
But when the officers stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transferred us to the police insecure in Szeged, he described to the paper.
The politician ended up spending nine hours in the cell.
The police were said to have behaved correctly, but communication was slowed as they did not speak English very well.
But prison, he said, was trite.
For example, in our cell about three by four metres, 15 refugees from Syria were crowded.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up there the next day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them next, Berg said.
What can't be entertained?
Ask the president of the Chamber of Bailiffs.
On Friday, September 18, the president of the Chamber of Executors, Pavla Fučíková, will answer the questions of readers.
You can ask her about changes to the Executions Act in force from 1 September 2015 as well as other items related to executions or executors.
Metcash launches campaigning in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches campaigning in the country to fight the invasion of Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relations with local food suppliers and are building the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are joining with brands such as Dunsborough, based on the Simmo's ice cream maker offering tastings in IGA stores, and shop owners selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, with food, alcohol and hardware retailer celebrating its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot of bets, because in southern and western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA's trade moves and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and Western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the SA and 24 percent in the WA compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will be frames at 5 percent of the food market in the two states in the 12 months since the opening of the first stores that took over the revenues from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers, to open up the first stores.
This week, in a report by Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that the IGA retailer could lose USD 360 million in annual sales and Metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the Western for the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and 600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes at the fixed price base of Metcash could cost it around USD 13 million in pre-tax revenue, confirmed Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that shoppers at IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the fund's senior manager, Hamish Douglass, founder of the financial group Magellan, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "high-level probably disappear over the decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglass's comment.
But it is known that Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and the profit-shielding profit and food business Metcash, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operating development of the change in speculation as sales and yields are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler has gone on a counter-attack and is investing more than $150 million a year to compare the counter prices in Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products each week to help IGA retailers re-equite by adding fast-growing meals and innovations from private citizens.
Metcash's Chief Executive Officer, Ian Morrice, says price-matching programs and retrofitting will catch up with the gradient, hoping that the wholesaler will return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis desends fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a minor loss in a recent fuss about his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, says President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention thanks to an affair with the notorious Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a keen qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be twice separated by the referee, Harrison said afterwards: 'Wawrinka should have drawn one to Kyrgios and I should have drawn it out as well.'
While he was last seen breaking up his racket after a cramp derailed by Richard Gasquet's possible climb at the US Open, Kokkinakis steadfastly defended Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he is competing with Sam Groroth for a second-chame standings behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I have thought quite intensely about the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi has been a little drawn into the whole dispute," Healy says.
He ruined his racket when he lost because of a spasm in the US, but he's not the first player to take out his racket's anger because of his frustration. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say he's not going to be proud of this event.
But he was in serious control very well because he was subjected to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a lot of credit.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he was treated with it a bit harshly.
He is a very adult 19-year-old man, he works very hard and he fits into the team well and so on, he never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he is in an amazing condition, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I just think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios for an important match starting Friday and says that a "mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports the Canberra native to return to the team as a long-term stand-in.
"First of all, we want our team to be totally focused on the game and not on all the controversy that came about [Kyrgios]," says Healy.
And I think Nick was climbing very fast, as Federer, Murray and others point out, growing rapidly in the public eye, making some terrible mistakes, and deserving of all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the limelight when he'll be able to think about it is the best solution for the team and for himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declare emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the announcement of the state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining those who attempted to cross it illegal to halt the influx of migrants.
Chaos arose at the border, while hundreds of migrants piled up in the no-man's-land, and Serbian authorities reacted with outrage.
Those who are stuck on the trails of the country between two states for an unknown period of time are those who flee from violence in their native countries, build tents and become settling in.
But there's a sense of frustration.
When a helicopter crosses over them, the migrants call together "Open the border!" and berate the riot squad of the Hungarian police.
Some reject food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declares that it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not just indirect harm.
During the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-state bloc did not come up with a unified immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share accountability for the 40,000 people seeking protection in the startled Italy and Greece and spoke with the hope of reaching an eventual agreement for the next month or at the end of the year, which would be accepted by the EU nations of more than 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened a special EU European summit on Tuesday to discuss the continental refugee crisis for another week.
Nevertheless, Hungary did not cherse its hopes for Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities a greater power to address the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up court cases of asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also planned to build a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania to stop the refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News Coronation Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point to the European Union for Refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go for a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalise the breach of the 4-metre fence that the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also set longer prison terms for those who transfer refugees illegally.
"Thanks to the situation caused by the mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged told reporters.
We are very clear on this: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, the parliament must still approve the deployment of the army, which was expected in the next week, but Associated Press reporters on the border has been observing a heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's home defence adviser, said the authorities were caught by 45 people who tried to cross the border and caught the 15 already in the state.
They penetrated with fence damage and are now charged in police custody with committing offences under the new laws.
The authorities quickly had the fence repaired.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a towed-wired towed truck.
The main border crossing at Roszke arose in chaos, as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container for processing and a crowd of people was being created.
About 20 of them fit in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees was blocking the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary by refusing food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders down by half in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (a drop from 58 percent), while Sanders comes in second place with 27 percent (incremented 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he will want to become president, has been receiving support from 15 percent of the Democratic primary electorate.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are clearly the decisions they will support for the candidate.
But the Clinton sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since CBS News last month, Clinton has lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton maintains a big lead between women and easing, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among the men has been significantly reduced and Sanders loses only 5 points to it.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated and is now equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has a big leadership thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders is only 5 points down to her in that group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across the nation say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would only support it for being a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
It's probably not surprising that Clinton's current followers are particularly fervorous about her.
Views are mixed among those currently underfpported by Clinton - only about a quarter would be enthusiastically supportive.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked about why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), the time is that it's time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
In addition, a great possibility of election and a match on the problems are cited.
While the vice president is considering a potential nomination for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to be in the face - a third think he shouldn't run.
When primary Democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second ballot for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half of Biden's second choice, much ahead of Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden ran for the run, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the best chance to win the general election; but that figure fell from 78 percent of last month.
Biden is far from second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to be the most likely to be up.
However, when it came to the question of the candidate's greater importance, democratic voters prefer to solve the problems over a greater chance to be elected.
Like last month, neither Democratic candidate or potential candidate is emerging as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, have had good results in some of the key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as sincere and trustworthy, and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden leads in honesty of all three, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have that opinion about him.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
As for all of these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
How questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state, continue, most of the primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation for the matter, and say that their overall view of her did not affect her at all.
But it's a different story among the American public.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public's view on the subject was divided in March, shortly after the problem emerged.
Most Americans claim that this email controversy has no bearing on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent have worsened their views on Clinton.
It is mainly Republicans, where more than 6 of the 10 claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy among her party's constituents, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honorable and trustworthy, a drop of eight points from last month, and by 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think it is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
But both Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush did the best perform in the honesty.
More people see Sanders as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, a lot of voters didn't give an opinion.
The error rate for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson quits Donald Trump in national election
Ben Carson draws closer to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates are responsible for half of the electorate in the latest poll, and the others are getting support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by an overwhelming majority, climbing from 23% of support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well in the runner-on across demographic groups, and eliminates Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the fields, with the exception of Carla Fiorin and Ohio Governor John Kasich, are behind by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, fell to the current 2% on the gallery.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place together with 6%.
The error span of a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was held in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week, showed that Carson improved and achieved 19% of Republican support for Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is well ahead of Carson.
On the upward trend of Carson, Trump decided to shoot in blind in blind at a retired neurosurgeon, and even to Carson apologized for questioning about Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said during the Iowa campaign last Saturday.
Five members of fraternity accused of the death of first-year student Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died during the overburden ritual of the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a murder charge was filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening of the ceremony in September 2013 and was taken to the hospital by the delayed, which contributed to his death, police reported.
The officers report that his eyes were blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand with a total weight of £30, and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach the target across the frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of Pi Delta Dogs Brotherhood did not call 9111 immediately after Deng fainted and reportedly waited an hour to get taken to the hospital, police say.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and basically preferred the well-being of fraternity to the life of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
He failed to revive him and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck by blunt force on the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of overburdening in fraternity, and at least one student dies every year for overburdening since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, in a statement.
The brotherhood and their members must be responsible and this step is important on the part of the institutions.
Monroe County's grand jury has recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with assault with overburdening and criminal conspirat.
"We want to detain not only the persons involved, but if there is an organisation that approved it, officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and national fraternity abolished its relationship with the local branches.
This is what tents when the Fed raises interest rates
Rate rises will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all of this.
What we don't know is how much time it's going to take and how long it's going to take.
For the economy, specifically, the history of the small originator offers the timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted for 86 months.
The aggarskit of the Federal Reserve in rate hikes is often, though not always, decisive in how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when rate hikes will start, but rather trajectories, how long normalisation will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the uproar may be exaggerated because of the speed increase.
"The Fed's first hikes since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the 'cheap money' era," Julian Jessop, the global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to a more common but still low one to create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen over the last month or so, the expected rate hikes may make the air a little volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for a re-stalling of shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again perhaps reflects the monetary policy lag," analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed's increase.
More specifically, the market in the last 35 years or so often the most - about 14 percent - is heading for a rate hike in the relatively flat in 250 days (an average gain of 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average yield from the last six cycles 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the main equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said the impact on the shares tended to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle and the return was beginning to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but a rate hike often helps it.
At present, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not yet existed and could hasten a recession.
Most notable is that gross domestic product close to its lowest point in history in the Fed's rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, during 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice the nominal year-on-year GDP increase was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect to keep it up, at just 1.5 percent in the third quarter, reports the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky and there could be a question "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were prepared for the Fed's growth for the full year, all eyes turning to the Federal Free Market Committee meeting this week and ending on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the increasing cycles so far in a super cycle of increasing leverage effect with GDP obscure the peaks of the start of the recession very quickly after the incipient recovery," the report reads.
On the contrary, this was a decidedly slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of those that the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we are still on.
The firm return was also volatile, as the market expects a rate hike and the model is somewhat similar to what the shares are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable for bonds than for stocks when the Fed changes policy direction.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/reduction cycle is on arrival.
At the end of the cycle, increases in bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rate hike will cause the yields to be approached between long- and short-date bonds, which will match the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, although "we are still cautious about the strain of the proceeds," Kathy Jones, a fixed-ownersfile retirement analyst at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already tailored to Fed policy expectations.
"Apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs of the market adapting to the outlook for tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit span has spread, and volatility has increased - all market characteristics as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the US will win interest rates after rising, and local products will become more attractive.
Multine-debt companies with a lot of debt will be doing worse, because the dollar rising will make their products more expensive in the world market, and their debt will be greater.
"History shows that the "quality" of shares tends to overtake over within three months of the initial rate hike," Goldman Sachsve analysts said in a client report.
Companies with strong balance sheets overturged weak balance sheet companies in each interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as low volatility stocks, also surpassed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt will become a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of moving interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure equity games, consumers are also mined by the growing dollar.
Savingsmen can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized this station for 'folking'
He takes the view that he is increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial opponent
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they just cheat the British
A colleague of the congressional colleague Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says even he is not an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "changed" at the Classic FM, says a leading MP and a pile of fresh pressure on the broadcast to show that they are doing something that commercial broadcasts do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's chief executions that the public service radio station seemed to be "felt" and becoming increasingly indistinctable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "hanged "- but it seems to be changing to the Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, appears to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that come to mind when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC's CEO rejected the allegations on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its business rival for live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I would not learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live with music and the creation of music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before, as the British are less educated in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's production to come under fire for treading on the heels of business competitors during the broadcasts of Kultura, Media and Sport and got to the committee's hearing.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a music talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talp Media for an estimated price of £22m.
Do you see why this programme is being discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George shine as judges - was made "in a typical BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "found a hit from its own stable" if it launches a fun series next time.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending the money of the feepayer's fee for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be to blame
For the first three months of 2015, they saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth was recorded since the records themselves began in 2000
Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that Thursday in November could be the reason for the hinge on spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping was on the rise, making many of Britain's main streets a ghost town.
However, experts say there are signs of stabilisation of online sales, and the new data shows a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August was the lowest increase in growth since the very beginning of the 2000 measurements, with an increase of just 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of stabilisation of online sales, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the level of growth for the past years and go back to 2000, the situation has always become rationalized over time," Andy Mulcahy, IMRG Sales Index Editor, reports to the Guardian.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnating and therefore it seems to be subsides.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken over from the Americas, is cited as one of the reasons for the drop in sales.
Experts believe customers could be delayed in shopping before the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, five times more than the average of shoppers turned to their computers to make purchases and to drop several retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which shoppers are haggling again, can withhold customers from further purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims bury victims of crane crash in Mecca and family Bin Laden sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were carried over the streets of Muslims at the performance of his first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse of the design tycoon Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane crash at the Grand mosque in Mecca. The bodies of the victims were carried along the street.
Dressed to some extent in white, the mourners chose their way and paid their respects to the victims when the first of the fallen made his final trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaissem.
The sad message passed the holy place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane had smashed through the mosque's ceiling and tore over to the faithful.
The bodies were released for the funeral, and the Saudi king sanctioned the construction group of the bin Laden family over the disaster, which was also abandoned by the 394 injured.
The bodies of the 29 dead after the crane crash in the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried by the streets
Among the dead were the father of the four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, the Greater Machester, who was at his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Haj Haj Fair.
Saudi officials have already promised that the snake to Mecca will take place and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group should not have left the arm of the crane at the top when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi press agency, states that the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the downfall.
The English disco agency service did not report this detail, but said that the company's bosses were banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are metalled before the Hadz farsa farsa of this month later.
Binladin Group did not issue any statement on the collapse of the crane and the in-called commentary was not available to his representatives.
The royal decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and a lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive building effort headed by the Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been in the vicinity of Saudi Arabia's ruling families for decades, running major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a renegade whom the family renunchwangled in the 1990s.
The crash happened in the midst of strong winds and rain just days before the beaten of millions of people in the kingdom at a pilgrimage that every proficient Muslim must take at least once in his life.
Officials say that 158 people still remain in the hospital.
Officials determined that one million riyals (£174,000) will be donated to relatives of the killed, and the same amount for permanently injured.
The other injuries will receive half of this amount.
B&Q chief says Eastern European traders working for cheap on the price of the trend
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is at the point of growth
The result is an open 200 Screwfix shops targeting traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Processed by Rupert Steiner, the main correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to be putting off hammers and brushes and handing them over to employed trained Eastern European craftsmen to work at their home
If you're good with a hammer or a paint brush, you seem to be in the minority today.
As the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to perform DIUI work at their home, according to the company's chief executive, behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns a chain for home-made household goods, argues that a large increase in the number of trained merchants from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores targeting retailers, and is closing 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laury says she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions at the store make better halves.
Currently, most of the male workers are male.
She said there was a need to address the growing demographic trends that depict more women's homes, which make more home-turning than in the past.
Ms. Laury says: "Still in our shops, it is mostly men who work in the shops.
We need to get close to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% of the decisions about the purchase of goods.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laura, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies under the UK's FTSE100 index, also re-turnerured her top-level team to reflect equivalence between male and female directors.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having half the representation of women among staff, including the executive and the CFO.
Ms Laury says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't difficult to find good women to take to us.
Kingfisher announced a slump in both profit and sales and sales, after the group took the cost of closing the deals.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of CZK 600 to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It is the justice of the equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
ODS President Zbyněk Stanjura noted that while the one-off contribution sounded good, it would be better in the long term to be in standard indexation, as it would be reflected in the coming years.
"We have room to find the mechanism to arrange it," said Stanjura.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaela Marksová (ČSSD), according to which it was to be indexed beyond the law next year.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said was not rosy.
A higher indexation next year, she said, would mean a budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and ministers are debating every hundred-million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past, the pace of indexation has lowered.
The rapporteur, Miroslav Opálka (KSČM), pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The right-wing vetoes will make the paycheck much more difficult and perhaps impossible in December, he said.
The chairman of the ČSSD deputies, Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed a reduction in the deadline for the standard in the committee to be discussed in the committee, which was also blocked by the right.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost the total cost of CZK 1.73 billion.
The money is to come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Next year, pensions should rise on average by about a penciletha.
The allowance should be given to the pension amendment by people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those whose pension entitlement to retired in December.
But they would have to apply for a surcharge in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions are indexed regularly in the Czech Republic as of January, by price growth and a third of real wage growth.
This year the pension is equivalent to 41.5 percent of the gross wage, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
The state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, according to the state's closing account, which was roughly five billion more year-on-year.
Spending on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all statutory expenditure.
The average full old-age pension rose by CZK 104 to CZK 10,714, according to data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and some 17,000 relative pensions.
Yakunin has abandoned plans for a political career, he will pursue science.
The Senate seat was almost assured, according to Russian media.
In the Federation Council, he was to represent the Western-Russian Kaliningrad region, whose governor, Nikolai Tugkanov, as the candidate of the governing United Russia party, defended his post in Sunday's election.
Under Russian law, senators are not elected by the senators, but are chosen by the governor from a trio of candidates whose names he announce before the governor's elections.
After the election, he will select the senator from the trio of candidates.
The complication for Yakunin was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
The Kremlin has found an exemption for Yakunin, saying he is an extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador to whom the statutory long-term residence requirement does not apply.
The filming of the Czech comedy The Theory of the Tiger was over.
The last drop in the main character's resolution is the voluntary death of his ordean, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Janžurová decided on her grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
John is clear that she and his wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová are on a similar journey.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, wanting to live with dignity and freedom again.
He is eager to regain control of his life - and as a solution he will choose to escape from the past one, said Nightingale to the story.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in comedy form in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the start, he said, it was clear that the lead roles would go to Bartošek, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
Yet, he said, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a lengthy break associated with the recovery after the serious illness, surprised him.
We made a deal with each other three years ago.
I gave him the script to read, and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I was surprised he was obviously a hooded athlete.
He used to ask the next scene where he would sit before shooting.
This time he rode his bike, climbed rocks and even walked up the hill.
And all in the record tropical heat, the director pointed out.
According to Bartoška, the women are taking the tiger to make it a rabbit over time.
They'll pour in some of his feed, but they'll close the door right away so he wouldn't accidentally think of playing outside the tiger crater.
And that's what we're trying to tell our film about, the actor commented.
His wife, who can be mildly negative for the audience, was portrayed by Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and she means well.
But she is also a usurpator and wants to bake her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also depicts the fates of John's married daughters Olinka and Alice - Tanya Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and the zysons of Erik and Pepíka - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film's producer is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and Televízia Slovensko.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google, an American internet company, has promised to provide up to $5.5 million ($132.6 million) to organizations that help thousands of refugees flowing to Europe.
This was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, a charity offshore of this internet company.
Azerbaijan canceled Teliček's part of the visit for criticizing human rights violations.
Czech MEP for the ANO movement, Pavel Telička, postponed the forthcoming trip to Baku on Thursday because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit today.
According to Telička, Baku is justified by last week's EP resolution, which criticises human rights violations in Azerbaijan and of which Telička co-authored.
By decision of the Azerbaijani Telička party, he lost the possibility of talks with official partners, as well as a visit to political prisoners that depends on the approval of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
Telička wanted to use the trip, which was planned for several months in advance, to meet with the parliamentary leadership and representatives of the executive as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent to the Czech Press Agency.
The EP resolution condemns the "unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan."
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent ruling over Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khaadi Ismail, who advocated uncovering corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky's visit to Novosibirsk did not rule out the creation of a Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We don't have plans like that yet.
But nothing is out of the question, he said.
Russia already has a long-leaf naval base in Syria in the port of Tartus, which it has so far used more as a service and logistics center.
According to Russian press reports, however, since the beginning of August, supplies of Russian weaponry and military equipment to Syria have risen.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from the trade agreements in force.
The Pentagon says the Russians plan to establish an air base near the city of Latakia, which for the time being remains a stronghold of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, US commentators agree.
US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov about the situation in Syria on Tuesday, their third telephone interview in the last ten days.
Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will travel to Moscow next week to convey concern about the gathering of a Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow's support for Assad as a lost bet.
He said of Russia's policy objectives in Syria that they were rather unclear.
Moscow, according to him, made Syria its satellite.
It may mean, it is said to mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is to be the main topic of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to today's speculation in the Russian press.
The situation in Ukraine's Donbass, on the other hand, is said to be not about to be discussed by the Russian leader at all.
According to a report by The New York Times today, the US government is not ruling out that President Barack Obama might meet with the Russian president during the UN session.
But the White House's advice is said to be breaking up so far.
Citing the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, TASS wrote today that Putin does not yet have a meeting with Obama on the schedule of his New York-based stay.
Bet the seed oil on the gall bladdio diet, the hemp helps boost immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is the use of extra virgin oils.
When pressed from cold seed, all healthy substances will remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gall blades.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these are the most common reason for the deaths of Czechs for several years.
The bale inflammation is mainly troubled by women, helped by sesame oil.
If you are one of the lovers of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in your pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used for heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gall bladeset diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
These are 90% of the cause of gall blades, and women suffer from these conditions 3 times more often than men.
In general, gallblady problems mainly involve overweight people who do not play sports and consume a lot of animal fats.
Seemam oil can be successfully used in a liver diet, which is very similar to the gall bladdile.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits of eating this oil, they should be wary of goods from exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use over-rare seeds to press, which have a more pronounced taste.
But the oil will lose all the active ingredients, described Ladislav Hačecký, the executive director from the Czech company Bohemia Olej from Kraslice in Sokolovsk, which produces cold-pressed bio virginal oils.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our press can be pressed 8 kilos of sesame.
Mechanical pressing heat the raw material to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for the extra virgin designation.
At higher temperatures, nutrients would be lost.
Sunflower oil benefits when it is ill with the heart and blood vessels.
The Czech favourite among the oils is sunflower.
Jarmila Hamerska's research, which led at Masaryk University, showed that 43% of respondents preferred it in the warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, it is already starting to be switched at 180 °C.
It is better to use it for salad seasoning, for example, and is particularly useful in the diet in which it helps to prevent cardiovascular disease.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which most reduce cholesterol from all fatty acids.
At heart problems, you should be careful about the amount of fat and calories taken overall.
For example, there are 62 calories in one spoon for sunflower oil, with 99 calories in a spoon of rapeseed oil.
When it comes to the energy value of food, it is important to be aware that natural foods with nutrients are far more appropriate than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
It is therefore advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower one lasts as sesame and hemp for 9 months.
The storage in the fridge will be longer shelf life longer.
The old oil is particularly recognized by the bitter taste.
In contrast, the defect is not ding for the deed.
It's a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
Hophero oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical cannabis are one of the so-called superfoods, which is why hemp oil is considered to be the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 of unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids the body cannot produce itself and one must take them from food.
Particularly important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study by scientists published in the European Clinical Nutrition Journal showed that the daily intake of the substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece will consume 0.6 grams for it, while the Icelanders will accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Canning oil should be included in the diet as part of the supportive diet to boost the immunity and heal of injury.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of the cell membranes.
People need not be afraid of using hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that it is one of the best-selling in Bohemia Olej.
It is sold 500 litres a year.
People often use one of the onion's on empty-wings in the morning.
Canned oil is not a tasteful, but it will strengthen immunity well, advised Daniel Vlček from the beauty company Bohemia Olej.
According to the statistics, the most passionate nation of barbecues is Americans.
There's a 1.4 grill for one household.
There are then various barbecue competitions around the world, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
The Czechs are not behind either.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have been grilled in their lives.
The vast majority of them then grill several times a year.
We must not underestimate the preparation to make the barbecue a successful - the ideal is to adjust the meat by marinating a few hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is the most suitable for this and at the same time leaves a health benefit for the barbecue?
As a general rule, in the barbecue process itself, it should be conserved with fat.
Experts agree that a large proportion of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils then also lose the body's beneficial substances, which we otherwise get from them when consuming oils from dishes prepared at lower temperatures.
But it doesn't mean that extra virgin oils don't find their use when grilling.
A grape oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When meat is said to be said, the experts from the company Bohemia Oil from Kraslice in Sokolovsk immediately equip the grape oil.
It is wonderful to complement the taste of the masses and the fish.
The kitchen features a unique feature of enhancing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, it thus stores health-grepositives as one of the few oils, describes the benefits of grape oil Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil, which is one of the few Czech producers of this vine oil.
Experts agree that the grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linolic acid and is therefore effective in fighting the excess of cholesterol.
In the grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favourable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increase metabolism and have a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming the grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brushing hair.
Chefs praise the use of the grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example when seasoning salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
The barbecue can therefore be used in two ways, in marinating and the barbecue itself.
By marinating the meat and the fish, we will preserve their succulence.
Three components present when preparing the marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, we will add acidity to the apple vinegar and thus achieve a softening of the meat.
The spice, in turn, gives the meat a taste and preserves the oil and gives the right bite, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, he adds, the grape oil is ideal for marinating because it can permeate it through dark meat as one of the few oils.
Marinated meat or fish are therefore ready for barbecue, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterised by the fact that only a few drops are enough to prepare the dishes.
The same goes for barbecue.
Some oils are a complete taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies particularly to lagoated, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Rub the grate with oil before grilling, preventing the food from burning.
The preparation of the attachments is also a necessary part of the barbecue.
Virtually anything is suitable for grilled meat and fish - grilled vegetables, roasted bread, a light vegetable salad and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Olej recommend, for example, the Hot Summer Salad.
To do it you need: • 1 piece peach • 1 bunch of rucola • 1 cup of sliced cucumber • 1 cup of salad leaf mixer • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl the mixture of salad leaves torn, sliced cucumbers and the drenched peach to the salad bowl.
Season with and pepper for the taste, you can also season with ground chilli and soy sauce.
At the end, drip with a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely sliced almonds.
Multitried sclerosis: it is not only the medication that matters, but also the will of the patient to fight.
Multitried sclerosis is a complicated disease, and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, a physiotherapist, a ergoter, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not just about therapeutic care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations, if they decide to have a child, social counseling, recommendations on housing arrangements, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can be fundamentally influenced by the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and not have to fundamentally change the style of his life.
As doctors point out, the passivity of the sufferers leers for the activity of the disease.
For example, regular movement has been shown to be significantly delayed by the time a sufferer needs a compensatory aid, such as a stick.
The important thing is that patients and their surroundings do not succumb to different myths, such as that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That is why the Get a Chance page (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give a Chance.
The most important person in caring for a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
For multiple sclerosis, the adage is said twice that the treatment of the disease is treated earlier, the more likely the doctor can have an effect.
This is because we have medication for multiple sclerosis at an inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process is not yet so strong.
The earlier we intervene, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and delay the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Rehabilitation care is very important in people with multiple sclerosis, which most often solicitate lower limbs or balance disorders.
The patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthening the pelvic bottom, relieving swallowing disorders or improving coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the patient's specific problems," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, head of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at the University Hospital Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests in a slightly different way for each.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
Motion activity, however, also strengthens the body's immune state, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that the sick are checking to do what they can do, and that reinforces their confidence.
"The exercise also flushs out with endorphins and makes you feel good," points out PhDr. Kamila Řasová from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Royal Vinohrady University Hospital.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We are directly interfering with the psyche and immune processes and stabilizing the disease, he adds.
"Previously, these patients were so-called spared, today we know that they need targeted burdens," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at the University Hospital Motol.
Physiotherapy aims to be able to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including a job.
Physiotherapists therefore work with ergoterpeias to give each person a compensatory aid made to his.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, it shakes people up.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to the heavy burden - the loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we're supposed to go to someone, not try to get carried away on our own shoulders.
"I work with them so that they will eventually come to the conclusion that even with a handicap you can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague-based manufacturer Latecoere, the Airbus would not fly.
Aerial production is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technologies.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or lightweight and solid composite materials that no one can soon be manufactured and processed.
Still, in addition to the super-picturing, computer-controlled machine toolmakers, you can come across something as ordinary as apricotas as apricot kits.
In a drum that resembles a pot for a cotton candy, the roasts of the sheets of the tin parts that have just come out of the milling machine.
"So far, no one has come up with anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of the Air Door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the area in Prague's Letňany, the former Letov produces a complete door for the Airbus A320.
They are the only ones in the world to deliver the door for Brazil's Embraer 170.
The door, part of which is being assembled in Prague, also enters the first and higher class passengers on the upper decks of the world's largest airliner, the Airbus A380 Airbus.
The doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner are also being assemblamined here.
Accuracy is the main motto.
For example, the torque keys are being used by the company to be set up twice a year.
If the yellow label lacks a check-up record, they would have a left to explain to the auditors of the Airbus or Boeing at the Prague plant, who come regularly to see if the doors are made according to the agreed rules.
The human senses, however, have not yet been completely replaced by advanced technology.
There are 1,500 rivets on one door to the A320.
These must be sprawters hand-cropped.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the falling hammer, they can tell if the rivets are properly tapped.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
It can rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimetres.
That's about twice the thickness of a human hair.
The check-up comes with a trained touch.
When the inspector runs his finger over a series of rivets, he'll know if one is out of tolerance.
Only then will he pick up the exact aberration.
The flight's pre-1989 program fed the L-39 military training aircraft.
But in 1991, neither was made.
The company had to find new orders quickly.
At the time, she hooked up with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the tender for the emergency door supplier for the A321 model.
The courtship with Boeing was not so happy.
"We were a small company for them at the time, which did not have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing's long-term stable deliveries," Dubský recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would remain slammed if Letov had not taken the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the International Aerospace Industry Association in 1999.
I spoke there about our collaboration with Airbus.
Negotiations with the French started the next day, says Dubský.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new contracts came with a strong company.
In 2000, the installation of parts of the door for the A320 started to be installed.
Three years later, the upper deck door was added to the A380s.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for deliveries to the Boeing Dreamliner.
We wouldn't get to these big contracts ourselves.
Maybe we'd do parts or small parts.
The partners want guarantees of deliveries for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubský.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion crowns and a profit after tax of CZK 147 million.
Exclusive position among aircraft manufacturers is not free of charge.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and certificates of qualifications for key employees.
Without them, the company would not have made any doors to the aircraft.
Getting certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers and keep them in repeated inspections costs CZK millions of crowns, according to Dubský.
Production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and stricter.
We need to train employees, retrofit the facilities and re-certify the whole process, Dubský adds.
Now the company is finalizing the preparation of a process for the zinc and nickel to reinfect the past for human health-damaging cadmium.
They received the assignment from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The people from Boeing are coming, screening the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They will also check our laboratory.
They test one set of samples themselves in their lab and then compare the results with ours, Dubský says, the way the customers check them.
The reward is for the Prague company's long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague plant today, the production of embraers is standing and falling.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door volume.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
But it doesn't mean he could say any price at the door.
The contract includes a price curve.
It indicates how many doors will cost one door in ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces made.
The price per piece keeps dropping to a certain limit value.
This price formula must fit in with.
If not, we'll lose money, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall, where the electric cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are assembled, is still empty.
But it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen, a new semi-robotic rip-taking and door mounting for the upgraded A320 Neo is being built here.
The rioting will be quickened and refined.
"This is the trend of fitting in aviation," Dubský adds.
The sales are secured by the future line.
Airbus reports that airlines have ordered 3278 new A320 units so far.
Just a few metres away, there will be a line for a complete installation of doors for the upper deck of the A30.
It's a strategic decision by our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, says Dubský.
Before that, however, the company must undergo qualification tests for, say, the installation of some electrical and electronic devices for the largest Airbus.
The company is also betting on the further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program to compete with the US Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit for the company to be able to process composite composites in addition to metal materials," Dubský says proudly.
However, the Latecoere is getting to the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no more place in the Letov area where it is located.
Prior to the French mother's entry, the company had 180 employees.
Now he has 800 of them, and within three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are racing to see how many hundreds of new planes the airline is ordering each year, they may not be worried about their jobs.
Although it has contracts for several years in advance, the parent company of Prague's Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for the loan repayments in September.
Eventually, Latecoere was able to reach an agreement with the main creditors.
At the end of August she exchanged some of their loans for shares.
The creditors received a 37.4 percent stake in the company by increasing the capital by €57.4 million.
The company's debt fell by two-thirds, or €180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company subscribed new shares to the existing shareholders for €222.9 million.
In total, it raised the registered capital by €280 million.
At the same time, the whole group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of the sales.
Average contract growth is expected to be up four percent per year until 2017.
In the custom book, he has orders for €2.6 billion, which equates to four-year production.
French media say Latecoester can finally take another breath after years on the drip.
The Czech race in Prague's Letňany is significant for the groups.
The group's sales are 16 percent.
Depending on its number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
Members supported the state's larger share of coal fees.
The change in mineral extraction fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state coffers than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of municipal budgets are to be neutral as the fee is to be higher.
In the year before last, municipalities received roughly CZK 450 million of the fees and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
The mining of brown coal was worth about 200 million crowns to the municipalities and the state to 66 million crowns.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the remuneration from the mining premises with the allowed mining to CZK 1,000 per hectare per year.
The revenue from these reimbursements is to continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that this would gain municipalities annually instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The recovery is newly calculated as the product of the amount of the extracted mineral and the rate for each mineral species.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda, however, warned against the fact that the setting of the fee by decree by government decree might not be in line with the constitution.
According to the Minister Mládek, however, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral, which is state property.
Fees are received only by municipalities whose territories are affected by the mining.
In the case of deep-sea coal, three-quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter of the state will receive.
The same ratio will be for the extraction of radioactive rock.
Some of the money the state collects in the mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after the extraction or to provide the Mining Rescue Service.
The draft was criticised today by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that they would damage the municipalities affected by the mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to have the Minister of Finance improve his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) chosen in the Ústí nad Labem Region.
Ahead of the rise in unemployment in Most, KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kucera wanted to return the bill to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining firms, the fee increase will not be made to the price of coal, as prices are more than 90 percent contracted in the long term.
So major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in reimbursements by seeking to reduce their operating expenses, which would mean a reduction in the number of employees in the first place," the government admits.
However, it says, the increase in fees is acceptable in terms of employment.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment to Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining, before the law is approved.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have repercussions for revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with the Met that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak Army should not be made until after 2020.
The limits at the CSA mine should be broken for social, economic reasons, and because of the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve is about to meet in two days' time on Wednesdays and Thursdays to make major decisions on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey by 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain inactive for some time, leaving interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It is a historic event because it has been a saddle flight since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get out of the zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has performed relatively well, with a recovery in the way of adding a trillion dollars to the state's account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less rosy global perspective.
They warned markets to be ready to raise, but the circumstances suggest that they also see great chances against the move.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday 20:00 CET.
Shooter at State University Delta left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi - and later that day on the same day - wrote a note claiming that he was "lame" of the first murder and that he wished to take it back was revealed by the government authorities on Tuesday.
Gautier Police in Mississippi said Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at State University of Delta, called the police around 10 a.m. on Monday morning
and said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send police officers to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there was a "cute dog" in the house that "will not bother anyone" but is upset.
The police demanded the caller's name, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the house was fired.
When the police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lambo that read: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving the message, Lamb set out for a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
The dean of the university, William LaForge, said he knew nothing of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "something was clearly taking place in Mr. Lamb's head."
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss's romantic relationship with Schmidt, government authorities said there was no "no evidence" of the "love triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who had been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person."
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but both remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was "shaken up" by the case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, Prentiss said, Prentiss worked from the house online.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would not go to jail."
When officers caught up with him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to a biography published on the school's website, Lamb received his doctorate in education at Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their charms
The actor (left), in a picture with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
He battled leukemia in 2001 and lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer in 2009.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
All of these things are certainly taking their toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be a few months out of the game for a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back has left this injury in tears and has been sidelined for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle by Héctor Moren in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the playground for nine minutes and an oxygen mask was also needed before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double broken leg and is now in the hospital."
He will be taken over tomorrow or perhaps the day after and then operated on in Manchester.
It's horrible - a guy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18 has it very hard, but he plays fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
Crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and he won't be able to play in the group stage.
I believe he will play again this season.
Moreno was very lucky to not get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee had been mistoa for her.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty procedure with both feet.
The Shaw account tweet says: "Thank you all for their reports, in words it is not possible to express how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins now and I will come back even stronger."

The England defender will have an added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the field with an injury like that, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the aim of our players to hurt the opp players.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in a match in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the oppor, and when you hear about the seriousness of such an injury, it's not good," said Cocu.
I haven't been able to notice this moment.
I only saw a ball that was heading in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see the save for Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
It makes me feel very bad, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after the procedure of Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
This is the thing known to every parent: when a child loves a book, it doesn't take long for them to memorize it almost from memory.
Of course, you mustn't be David Cameron.
Asked by the child scheme provider, to name the children's favourite children's book, Prime Minister Lorax, a fowdek from Dr Seuss, was chosen.
It was hard to choose, writes Cameron in a report posted on the SuperCamps website, and goes on: "Visive, touching, creative and with strong content, I liked to read one of those to my children, because behind it was always an image or a message that I had not seen before."
Well, then, that in the following paragraph, Cameron allegedly described the plot of the book based on the lift from the 2012 film, which added additional characters and details to complete a brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the hearts of a girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," is the short version of a book chronicle that records the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it weren't suspicious enough, the text supplied by the Cameron reads as the summary elevator of the film Lorax, which is found on the Internet of the Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by the walls, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of a girl of her dreams, Audrey."
Being an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would be acquainted with the plot of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is devastated by the raking, the trees-cropping the industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the titular Lorx, the crouched, the mustachioed creature who "speaks behind the trees."
In all likelihood, so relatively little-image PR task was given to a sidekick who had never read Lorax to the child 20 times in a row.
A spokeswoman for Downing Street said the text was most likely from the office of Cameron's supporters.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by a Cameron employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in jeopardy England's omission but still holding
Riving with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the team England's pick on this tour, I think a repeat of the 3-90 defeat they suffered in the test series last time will be less unlikely.
I would also not directly rule out the visitors' win.
Alastair Cooka's party may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in this bounty set, and also the collective thinking is strong; they will not bring the scars from 2012, only a youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner, and Adil Rashid, although he is unknown at the test set, represents the offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of the England team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is a tough challenge for me to analyze, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were up against two good attacks in challenging conditions and simple, but the harsh reality is that the players of the cricket are judged on the basis of performance.
There were no question marks around the name Joe Root, for example, which led to the announcement, because-and I've said this before-the players are their best selectors.
A few more half-century, and Lyth could have extended his streak, but he had control over his own fates.
Hopefully, if he can get more runs for the Yorkshire, there's another opportunity.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his stance, even though his performances were not entirely 100 per cent, and I'm not surprised; he was always a team player.
The question of how many test time a baton gets to show up is a tough nut.
Lyth was given seven caps-as well as Sam Robson before him-while Nick Compton had won nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and away.
The only thing you could grumble about is that England gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean first-behis, even though Lyth was at his best-but this wasted opportunity is a thing of the past.
Here comes Alex Hales and he's a baton who I rate very positively.
He's a x-factor cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he got 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors have been given, but of course all of this will depend on the overall line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting at Cook's side, who would get another extra spinner while he'd keep four quicks, was raised and I have no reservations about it.
I don't understand why the machine can't be fired and this left-handed man has already shown that he is an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 to them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 rehearsals before his performance in 2001.
He had managed immediately three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a backup spinner and when I had the chance to watch him, I was intrigued as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough stats - an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a pram, but there aren't a lot of spinners to raise their hands, and the selector opted for their youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, it appears that England have made several changes and clever addition to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batter, as a consultant for the test matches, can be a masterpiece.
He's one of the most beautiful-plays playing guys who bring a lot of experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in a part of the white-ball tour and brings both the energy and the merciless sparkle to the team.
I always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and, like Mahel, possesses the intellect that can be used.
The new voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can occasionally lighten up and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes was given a one-day leave, just as Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this decision.
Even if many disagree, coaches and selector do not create a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
The ill-conceived strategy of David Cameron's renegotiation to keep Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with each passing day without the election of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the head of the Workers' Party, or will TUC take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is mired in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States have already had enough of the British egocentric agendas, dividing concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly did not want.
At its one-year meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided they didn't want it even if they eroded social protection.
We can even call it a selfie Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home, saying they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to be wrestled for Britain in Europe in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggesting that some of the short-sighted ministers and officials in some of the capitals have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before she becomes a bad one, as has been the case with the long-time continued Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also declining.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right-hand side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see the legs of the French breaking their legs in helping the Selfie, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the 2017 referendum campaign in the UK to hasten the Brexit process, says a friend.
"The renegotiation has solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value in the negotiations."
Europeans, to their own detriment, know how predatory Fleet Street can be and how sceptical the EU is by the press oligarchs barons, because they were not 2-1 in 1975-inspired referendum in 1975 that supported our entry in 1973.
They can vaguely remember the name Boris Johnson, the outrapply Euro-oportunist who made his name for himself as the Brussels-based "EU straight bananas" correspondent in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of bad guys not paying taxes, foreigners wackling phones, and pseudo non-interorations that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same about them, but he realized that when you were in a cage with a frantic gorilla, you had to throw bananas to her to keep you for dinner, and then to tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opted for Cameron's referendum routine, ever since Blair admitted the principle of the abolished EU constitution that was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and won him a drop card.
The press never forgave him either.
But the kind Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pats on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him that he must no longer waste his time on me - seems in danger of accepting the strategy of the boycott of Murdo Neil Cilinack, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to work out coherent media engagement strategies, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair he left at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe, I will say it pleasantly, is evolving.
He argues that he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the frantic tendencies of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly accept that.
Hilary said the same thing "Bemm, but not by Benniite" Benn on the radio and television this week when his inner scout could not commit to admitting that Corbyn's appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
The Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But to fight to stay 'at all the circumstances' - Benn's phrase - it was by all accounts not what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC told colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - don't forget, he touched me, too - the discipline of the news remains important in the ages of all-day television and especially in the faith, the parochial of paranoia and betrayal, which are the social media
It is fair to not give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to regard the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign as self-evident, as McDonnell put it.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell's and Corbyn's basic preoats about EU membership - in line with their Bennite besieging the economy, the anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic bickering.
As with his fuming about Nato-Temorse, Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their landlords.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions when it seems pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the brisk 'weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the costs of the Conservative government in power, as I was recalled at the launch of Monday's launch of what was the Security Forum of British influence.
Experts criticise review review of electronic published by Public Health England
A government-funded statement by the agency that e-cigarettes is 95% safer than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people from whom some have connections to the tobacco industry, the researchers say.
Experts writing at the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet with the criticism of the evidence used in their e-cigarette report by the Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published the "Scricia" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the comprehensiveity of the data and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editor in the Lancet expert magazine last month attacked the "extremely flimsy base" on which the PHE agency was setting up its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ disputed the claims that were supposedly "bued on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, a professor at the European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of efficacy."
They acknowment that the public might expect that the PHE claim is "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called to draw up an analysis of the multi-criteria decision (MCDA) of the model to synthesise their views on the damage associated with the various products containing nicotine; the results of the negotiations were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell report that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had reportedly previously raised funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the public health mandate BAT in the Sustainability Report, he says.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting awarded funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, but the financing it allegedly obtained earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International is supplied.
The reason for selecting the panel members is not available, but they do contain a few well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industrial financing in the newspapers.
Some of the other people present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting in PHE was also attended by the tobacco management.
A report produced in this group "toughes to be eloquently admitted," the missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to the majority of the products," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations is described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the claim in the BMJ had already been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small compared to, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows, and also what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers of tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people a year die of smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS$2 billion a year.
Clearly emphasizing the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not without risk, they bear only a fraction of the damage caused to smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should end with EastEnders, former Channel 4 director says
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "gate a real-hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said the licensing fee should only be used for programmes that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programmes that are likely to be watched by only a handful of people in the intricate broadcasting times of "the biggest rating show, and on channels like the BBC4.
After General Manager Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to merge with the BBC for the six full years he had worked on Channel 4.
"I am afraid of the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programmes that would certainly have been broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson said on the Upper House Communications Commission, as part of the BBC's future negotiations.
If you maintain royalties that I am not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, the creation should be reduced, at least in terms of programmes that others are not producing or not.
They're broadcasting The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would have sent it is a ridiculous joke, and understandably nonsensical.
Johnson said: 'I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded in a non-pursuit.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced on home soil.
Honestly, other channels would give them their right-hand hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasters are.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, the show's businessman, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty about catching up with ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the BBC's most popular show reiterates those that former Sky Managing Director, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sells a show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the more crivous BBC public service programmes "transfer to the BBC4, where quite often the audience cannot be measured, but they are fulfilling their authority and can argue when they are preparing to justify the £4bn income from the royalties on their hypocritical mission, "But of course we do all of these obscure programs that no one is looking at."
They're being sent when they're not being looked at.
As for the royalties fee, Johnson told the commission: 'I'm asking you to find a more regressive system on which one will get the best value.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a large sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look at the BBC that much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, told the BBC that the BBC should review its reithan mission in the sense of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that the BBC's small production volume was now previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take as a model of public public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and turn into "informing, clarifying and entertaining."
On the subject of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms, which were broadcast on television only a handful, and contact commercial reporters so that we can see them all online.
‘Sonogenetics’ or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how the sound pulses affect the direction the nematodes move.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified neural system that can be controlled by sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are hit by sound pulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching off the cells of genetically modified motor neurons, which are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity with light
Scientists have reported that these worms are a great example of a new methodologies called sonogenetics that use ultrasound to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells and activate outside the body.
Sekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes are injected into the patient's brain's brain, which stimulate the brain. The method is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
The boogee usually doesn't respond to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction would come when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles he discovered were amplified by ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the worms' bodies.
The reinforced ultrasound waves are active in the TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells they are linked to, a report from the journal Nature Communications.
To control the nematodes using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain the ion channels of TRP-4.
When he then applied ultrasound to the worms so modified, the sound waves were reinforced with microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turned on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is much like optogenetics, a pioneering instrument that allows scientists to turn on and off the neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, has been quoted as saying that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fibre to the desired place in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate the tissues without any limit and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasonic signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of insulin-producing muscle cells and cells.
An illegal torture device - right on your doorstep!
Advertisittings to bish Britain's arms deal.
Watch the anti-weapon market video from Amnesty International.
The menacese killer drones!
Legs to the legs that are breaking the ankles!
Triple missiles!
And electric stunning batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The hilarious voice and caricature of the metaphor leave no doubt that this advertisement at the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defence and security facilities of the International Veselice at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands district.

But a stand-alone campaign is also conducted with the surfaces of the bus stops and the yards that require a second view.
"Important notifications, DLR travel from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using a font with the London Undergemark plates with the DLR lines to become a tank image.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DLR ... Customers are being asked to help stop the arms deal.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismaland.
The Special Patrol Group collective helped distribute them all over London and using the "Ad Space Hack Packs," which is £6 apiece of the Allen key, which supposedly "gets access to about a third of the planet's bus advertising space."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies made by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the galleries.
Many artists are switching to work with activists as part of the protest movements and realize that they must get out in the real world in order to have an impact on their art.

The Amnesty video was viewed by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the VCCP agency working without the fee and the graphic designer and the commentator also worked for free.
The VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, would be surprised at the silence surrounding the arms store ads - he saw an empty spot on the ExCeL calendar - and he thought, "Let's show them a campaign to avoid."
They were tow the creation of a more realistic risky corporate ad, but "admitting colorful colors and animations, we've made it attract more people."
"They did a fantastic job and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that the torturing device is not being traffically on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the weapons store comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab uncovered an order from the U.S. military on "the AT4CS RS launching arm."
This includes "a unique shaped warhead that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."

Eight golden rules for living in a student dormitarian
11 years ago, I moved to the college of students as an oblivious 19-year-old boy, still a barele-believer and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the tense smiles of those I'd wocked - and numerous, lengthy, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The move on the tracks can range from slightly to the nerves of the going to the totally appalling.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, if you took a year's break, what your opinion of Corbyn is, and why "you don't really love Marmite or exactly hate Marmite, because it's just a HAHAHA fermentation extract, I'll be in your room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath, too - ask and express interest.
It's going to have a conversation and it'll help you find the people you love, and the ones you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they'd release the fire-fighting machines.
Leave the people's space.
People's rooms are often converted to drinking receptions, movie evenings spots and communal public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and customize their underwear.

The introverti in college will come in short.
Your room should be a haven, yet a lot of colleges turn into an out-of-room walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This may be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I've used to talk to you."
Try to see when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe write him a place to knock.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
A boy in my dorms was in the habit of having a door locked, he was invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make your friends by baking.
Having started going to the university at the top of the baking mania, knocking on a stranger's door and the show with the baked cakes baked, it seems slightly less odd, than "Welcome to the neighbourhood, I've baked you a little, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you, and maybe it will all end up by adding your face to a tasty surprise.
This is, of course, the object of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and augment, are likely to guarantee that others will pretend to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
The theft of food is a common crime in student dormitories.
The theft of the whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is there a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Check with the milk owner twice.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're in a rave.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more mature than my roommate, who swapped her milk for a dishwashing device to punish the thieves.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noises that disturb people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, it's also about being the proverbial people in the glass houses.
A girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could keep up drum and bass a little bit because it was 3 at night and had a test in the morning.
Their response was to amplify the music.
When they finally died quiet at 5 a.m., she let them sleep peacefully for two hours, and then played her own music out loud, locked the door and went off for her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife went to the same dormitories as you?
Conversely, wouldn't it be appallingly embarrassing for your roommates to get married to their future spouse, to have sex, to break up, and have to see each other every day, and perhaps take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, you're not going to make heart's heart - but if your hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try to talk to your weaknesses a little.
At an uplifting moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their unmoredbed room, there is only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good prank is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson of their security by hiding something - never whip someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a water bottle, which you then shove in the freezer - but never stick their stuff on the ceiling for more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a rough time while already pregnant with the now seven-year-old Vítek.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone to prepare and raise her offspring.
I came to terms with the situation quite quickly - I was very much looking forward to the child and looking for positives in it.
I was not trying to worry about the uncertainty and being alone with the child.
And I certainly had the hope that we wouldn't be alone for a long time, Eva recalls her first pregnancy today.
Already at that time, she met on the internet at the cottage of the elder Vasek, with whom they began to talk about their favourite films.
Vasek even brought Eva and Vítkem home from the maternity ward, but he did not rush into the role of stepfather.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while," Eva described in the documentary series Four in That 3.
The motive for the third series of the Czech TV series is just the search for happiness at the second attempt.
She managed to care about Vítek and the family's financial security thanks to part-time work and great help for her mother and the help of her aunt.
Even the prospects for responsibility for a foreign child did not ultimately spoil Vasek's affection for Eva.
They finally got together around Vítkov's second birthday and he now understands Vasek as his dad and he also calls him that.
Although Vasek already has two adult daughters, she says she is enjoying her fatherhood at the age of sixty and is also more devoted to children.
In addition to Vítek, they were joined by two-year-old Leontýnka and eventually twins.
"Vasek came into our family sort of naturally, perhaps even because my mother never spoke to me much about my relationships," the smiling Eva thinks.
Little room?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born by caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which are then found in the blood of the pregnancy and are particularly manifested by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother after childbirth usually subtly subset.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eva and Vasek's happiness, even though they were only at 36 weeks.
The emerek was placed in an incubator in the intermediate department, where Vasek's niece also works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and right after being transferred from the ICU to the room I had it with me, she describes the challenging period after giving birth to Eva.
She spent twenty days in the maternity ward until the doctors had called for the release of the babies, who had managed to reach the two-kilometre mark.
Waiting to take on the children in the maternity ward did not make Eva happy.
"I was a maddening longing for my husband and my children," the mother of four-times recalls of the six-week ward.
She and her husband considered signing a reversal, including because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
But this did not happen in the end, and the doctors released Eva and the twins into home care.
The four pregnancy and births are broadcast by T1 on Tuesday evening at 9:45 p.m.
A fairly large family can be cut back.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric two-water and cramped conditions.
The house did not get more air, but Vasek made Eva happy by mounting a gas cooker to make the food preparation more comfortable for six personal.
If it's at its best, we'll take turns taking a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive especially the family's well-being and pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or the topoeness of the cottage.
For now, we've put together very nicely, better than we expected.
The mess is harder to hide in a small space and we sometimes cross the cut-out babies, but at least we are all close by, smiling Eva, who can find a positive side for every situation.
Vasek's work lighting fieratte for the film is no guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes hikes into the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
At the age of 60, he says, he is physically managing the care of the finances of both the family and the children, but how long will it be like this?
"I realize that, given our age difference, it will be me who will feed this family one day," Eva admits frankly when questioning about the future.
She would like to return to her job, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four children, I'm not exactly a big deal for my employer.
And when it's at its worst, my husband and I can take turns taking a cab, jokes a sympathetic blonde.
Apple suffered a yo-yo effect.
It's all the display.
A more powerful processor, a larger-resolution camera, a firmer chassis or a touch-reel-recognition display are, in the shorthand, a shorter, forerstanders of the ninth-generation iPhones.
The last two then also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weights of the iPhon 6s and 6s Plus.
In fact, Apple's current trend has been that every new generation of the iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth-generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference to the detriment of the novelty was really negligible.
However, this is far from the case of new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight grew by 14 grams for the smaller model, and the larger one by a full 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is not surprising, last year's affair by bending in Apple's pockets was greatly tormented by Apple.
The innovation chassis is made of the more durable aluminium alloy 7000, which was also reflected in the weight.
But the displays have a much bigger impact on it.
In fact, Apple used 3D Touch technology for the news, making displays recognize the power of touch.
To do this, the display had to be fitted with another layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the new iPhones' displays has thus increased more than double the size of previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone, from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, and for a larger one, from 19 to 40 grams.
For the iPhone 6s, the display is the toughest used component.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved in this novelty thanks to the foumage bark, which touched most of the remaining components.
The larger model is then the most difficult feature used for the battery, but its weight has not changed in any way compared to its predecessor.
In this case, too, the biggest increase is noticeable for the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus is thus 192 grams.
The extent to which the new display technology will be practical will only become apparent when used.
First users will be able to try this out as early as Friday, September 25, when sales of the iPhon 6s and 6s Plus will be launched in selected countries.
Are the breakfasts of champions's breakfast for tens of thousands of years?
In Grotta Pagllicci, Italy, archaeologists have made a find that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of the settlement of modern man from different eras, including wall paintings, remnants of instruments, and so on and so on.
In the 23A layer, which according to the tools is dated to some 30,000 years ago but the scientists discovered but something that is very reminiscent of the remnants of a breakfast buffet.
In fact, there were traces of oatmeal grains on the site, which, to look at the eye, had apparently gone through the process of producing such popular flails.
At that, the grains are first soaked, then dried, stripped, the so-called pluch, then frawled and spins the flat.
In the cave of Paglickci, the beans, which appeared to be uproaned or steal, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least the marks of use on the two stones in the cave.
So scientists have failed to prove in their publication to PNAS that there is a complete process of making the faulevees in the cave, but the similarity is really very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat the ploughs, but the assumption that it was with some kind of liquid and quite possibly warm is, of course, quite logically offered.
At the same time, it is a very interesting illustration of how intensively people used cereals long before the creation of agriculture.
For if the lingle interpretation is correct, the oldest ineshew was overtaken by agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
New station reports in the Transportation Enterprise of the City of Brno.
So I listened once again to the names of the names of the trolleybus stops: Hnusáčkova, Ghost, Frázova, Spratecká.
Sure, the trolleybus was a bit noisier, so the report in a man's voice was somewhat less understandable than before, when the stops were reported in a woman's voice.
The woman's voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of the traffic he is more discernible than the deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know, who, no one asked me, but they certainly chose that from studio recordings made in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different from the noise of the bus engine.
I have lived in Brno for a good few decades, so I know the correct names of all the stops from memory, so I don't need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere who don't know each other in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended can be confused and can be confused at the end, where they accidentally arrived, then claim that the stop at which they were to speak has not been reported at all.
Perhaps the selection of the announcer should be made again - but better again the announcer - and this time tinged with the usual traffic noise and the clattering of the engine, in which the speaker's beering on the bus is almost lost.
So we don't have to listen to the names of the stations of Water Heršpice, Šmírova, or then immersion in the creaking shingle, to which I transferred in Komárov.
I assume my old-age hearing didn't deteriorated at once so much in the one day the stop's announcer changed.
I understood the reports well before that day.
Good morning, comrade chief.
From the track notes.
Today, few people know what the so-called comprehensive background checks were under the party's biggest and smartest.
I took the liberty of reminiscing about it.
The bus was late.
I bumped into the dispatcher's office the moment it was said from the radio that it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't collided with the comrade chief, he came in a minute in front of you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," the dispatcher observed as I entered the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write to me that I am driving around the precincts to revise the minor mechanization.
It's not going to work, there's clearances today.
Everybody's fucked up, it's a horror.
What is it all about?
"You'll see," the dispatcher said.
Next time you'll be too.
I ran out into the corridor.
Then the chieftal door opened and the chief appeared.
Stried, stony-faced, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I said respectfully, quickly buttoning up the two buttons of the uniform's jacket.
"Good morning," came the reply, and I ran quickly to the second floor, not realizing the cold, ominous tone the old manen had answered.
"You're playing mess," said the engineer Eva, an elderly lady to whom I respected greatly.
She said she was even a chief before the comrades deposed her.
There are background checks, and you'll arrive barely.
How many times have I asked what the comprehensive background checks are, but nobody wants to talk about it too much.
They say they're once every three years, they all have to join them, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
I'll see.
I pulled out of the drawer's fascikl with periodic reports and then the phone.
"Horcman here, come to me right away," the chief's voice said.
What's bothering?
Now we met and nothing ..." I muttered, but no one answered me, each with their thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I came at your command," I fade, fainted, stepping into the chief's office.
The chief sat behind the desk, looking at some of the papers.
"Comrade Mechanator," he said after a moment, without raising his head and still carefully examining the mold, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the machine on the table, leaned back in the back of his chair, and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, prickle gaze.
I'm uneasy.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised himself for the fact that in the few months in office I had worked very well and that he was very happy with me.
That the chief did very well to pull me out of the platoon at the distance.
Now this?
You realize you're a track-reel distance technique and you have to act like it.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I stutored that I've used such a greeting since I was a kid, that I was raised so much and that I didn't see anything wrong with it.
For the chief, it was like a red rag on a turkey.
"You are on the socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is the honour of the work," the gleaned chief froced.
Plus, you're still knitting the name of your superiors.
One day you say "sir" and the second time you say "comrade."
But I'm not Mr. Chief to you, I'm the Comrade Chief.
The deputies are the comrade deputies, the upper trackers are the comrades-in-chief of the trackers!
Please remember that!
Excuse me, sir... comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with a routine civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of the job or the comrade ... you know ... I'm not in the party...
"It's not your preference that you're not in the party," the chief said coldly, calming down a bit.
It's still going to be mentioned.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a pension prepaid upstairs.
That was not good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his preference, it didn't look good with the person.
He gave me a cold, prickling gaze for a moment, and I searched for the words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his condescending tying.
He was only a few years older and playing the Lord, comrade-in-kind.
The heel, the cocky, authoritarian, arrogant, the way he was at the moment.
He's all popping out.
So be it, he's a chief.
In fact, not all of them, the chairman of the party organization, as all partisans, but also independents, were on the first to first-face.
But the chief tos to many, especially those with whom he could exercise his superiority.
He's just wiped me off for total bullshit.
I thought of something about the ass and it took enough to overt shoot him in the face.
But then I wouldn't even go back to the bush, let alone keep working as a railer clerk.
What would I feed two kids for?
Plus a built-up house!
I felt like crying, but I took control.
I won't make him happy.
"That's all for now, you can go," the chief said, ending the audience, and began to look closely at the file he had been in hand again.
At eleven-thirty, I was summoned.
Everyone in the office was already there, and to questions about what and how, they said, right, that it would be good.
Only Jonzh said tartly, as was his custom, that they could not fire us all, because the comrade chief himself and his faith-give would have to do the job, and that he was not imminent.
The word "comrade" emphasized as if he knew what the morning old had wiped me off.
The chief's room was a pretty get-duty.
Comrade chief behind his desk and at the long council table other comrades who were to decide on my clerical being or not being.
Kádrovák, chairman of the ROH, the staff writer, the special-purpose officer, the manner of contour in the army, and the deputy, my boss.
And the person most important, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the sting.
An ordinary track worker, he sanded the sleepers or pitchforks to throw gravel.
But also a former guard.
There were rumor that he had been no fun at the time, a pretty beast, he said.
Evil tongues said he came out of school in the seventh grade, didn't learn anything, he didn't know anything.
And when the crime was canceled, he ended up on a crump's crump.
But comrade, yeah, comrade was forged!
The chief motioned me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an uncooperative concoat in my throat.
Kádrovák read the opinion from the citizens' committee from the residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two children, and so on and so on.
So far, so good, I thought, and I was breathing a little better.
Then an opinion from the party's street organization.
He copied the opinion from the citizens' committee, perhaps both of which were written by the same man.
But then it came!
Parents of the longtime party members, refused to appear before the screening committee and subsequently with the party, reportedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The cadre saw it and stopped reading.
The chief motioned to continue.
Beyond that, it was only worse.
I was a member of the SSM Municipal Committee and there I was won as the party's candidate.
Regardless of the parents who left the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and I had a wedding in addition to the national committee in the church.
I have failed the party's confidence in the worst way.
That's why I was removed from among her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even for my mother, when she died, I gave the church funeral, though she was a former member of the party.
By all this I show a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the cadre was finished, only the tapping of the chief's pencil at the tabletop was interrupted by a tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.
In doing so, I kept repeating to myself "Communists - superhuman, communists - superhuman." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could repair the switches without some fucking background check.
But now?
The career of the railcler was taken over before she started.
Go back to the platoon?
I don't think the chief will go out for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you check out the comrade-in-chief?" the chief interrupted the tense silence with a question to the cadre.
Well, according to the previous job report.
You got him here?
The cadre was obviously not twice in the offing.
On the grain of sweat, he winked nervously, as if he had been vetted himself.
He nodded zealously and handed the chief some paper.
"Well," the chief said, with a hint of joveliness, which often was a prefuscaliration of the storm.
At first glance, all the praise, trained with honours, graduated from industry, worked in the task wage as a locksmith, the standard averaging one hundred and twenty per cent.
But the essentials are missing.
Where did you get the report, comrade?" he said to the cadre again, who felt that it was somehow beginning to turn against him, and that very soon he might not even be a cadre.
This is where the comrade gave it to me, at the onset.
That's enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the platoon district," the cadre babbled.
And there's no reimitating, his was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were included in the technical function, this scrap of paper was enough for you," the chief said dryly.
The cadre winked nervously, and had no answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss that later," the chief concluded, and the cadre was clearly relieved.
For now, he's withstands it.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief asked me again.
Suddenly it's up, so that's the end!
My eyes were darkened, the heat doused me.
There was a torrend of reproach and accusations, and I knew I was the most heinous creature in the world who deserved no mercy.
That by planting an incomplete report I misled the comrade of the caddler's caddler, not understanding why the report was incomplete when I received it from the cadre in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element that, at the time of the construction of real socialism, supports the restell of religious obscurantism, even participates in them.
That, that, there was a lot of what I did, or maybe I would commit, and I was quietly praying that it would be over.
I didn't care about everything anymore.
I didn't care if I'd fly the mechanic out of the position.
I didn't care about being taken by the pick.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of the comrade chief.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," the party chairman said suddenly, emphatically interrupting the chief's levities.
This is where the comrade made a mistake, a tremendous mistake.
What a mistake, he did the stupid thing!
But he's already been given his punishment!
You don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young person than to close the door to the side for a time!
To reopen to him, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
The Ignorated Bach was a book.
Where did he get it?
Is he so well-read or parroted phrases from partisan training sessions and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who's to give it to him if not you, comrade chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat mislead comrade, in his efforts to make amends!
It's your party duty that no one can get rid of!
Actually, it's a partisan duty for all of us, too.
The comrade here must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the chairman was finished, no one was even fumbles.
No one expected such a reversal of the situation.
At least me.
"I agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the chief agreed icically, in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you had me finished, you'd hear that's the conclusion I was headed for.
They all nodded in agreement, but you could see that they didn't believe him a word.
"So I was confirmed for the job of a stand-alone officer in the care of the basic means," I wary of returning to the office, and then I began to cry.
Good thing, apart from the engineer Eva, everyone was at lunch.
She silently listened to my incoherent makeup of fresh experiences, and in the meantime I relaxed.
When I finished, she asked if I'd like some coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the cooker and prepared the mugs.
Meanwhile, she talked about the cadre practices.
How one opinion, often full of praise, is in the hands of a person, and the other, in which there is every filth, is sent to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to, but on a hike at the pickaxe, so the comrades from the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cadre?
He just cares where he would eat or drink what, and so it turned out the way it did.
"He'll get it from the old man," she said mischiefly.
He's not going to like it today.
Beware of him anyway, he's pretty vindicable.
And the party chairman?
Basically a far worse chief, no leishil.
Zero from a pickaxe with great power.
The coffee water began to heat, and the next thing the office was filled with the scent of the coffee.
I dropped a sugar cube into the cup and stirred the hot potion silently.
I hope I'm the worst of it.
They're not kicks me out now, and the next checks are for three years.
Anyway, the comrade chief won't soon forget me that day.
Publishing in the anthology LITERTITERI II. in the publisher EPIKA
The symbol of the village was a tovished.
The wheel of the windmick above Chlum is once again in the years.
It can be seen from far away because it is located on a 15-metre-high mast.
People from a wide area call him "the airl at Chlum."
For the municipality of 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the municipality received to mark the covens' reunion in 2010.
"We asked for a sign at the time and of course we wanted to have a fan on the sign, everyone knows it in the area," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum Wind Pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a bit of a memento of the present: it recalls a time when people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a rarity.
It was not until 1910, that the Chlum's representatives decided to address a solution that suited it until the mid-1980s.
In the village at the turn-off on Číchov, they dug up a seven-metre-deep well.
Three years later, they supplemented the well with a metal structure with a wind pump that pumped the water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by the company Antonín Kunc from Hranice na Moravě with a cost of 2,400 crowns," says the commemorative inscription on the ground-floor fence of the mast structure.
The pump, after several repairs and wind wheel falls, served in 1971.
On 7 May 1973, a new chapter in the fight for water began to be written: a new water supply began to be served in Chlum that day.
The wind pump was left only with a dysfunctional municipal symbol and a rarity here.
The dominant feature was put into operation at this year's reunion of the natives.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlumes decided to repair the wind wheel again and put it back into operation.
They had a replica of the original wheel made - a scaled-down half a metre in diameter.
The bike was fitted to the mast, but that same year it had to be brought down.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the right material and the bike could not resist gusts of wind.
Then the Chlum's landmark rested for several years dismantled under the roof.
But from this June, the bike on the high mast is rounding up again.
On the occasion of the students' reunion, the village had the replica of the bike altered and re-enapoped it to the top of the iron tower.
But the bike draws utility water from the well only into the overflow blind shoulder.
And we completely disconnected it over the summer because there was little water in the well.
It was at least empty-handed.
"In the autumn, we will disconnect the wind wheel shaft from the pump in the suction basket again," Mayor Mašek explained.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where a wind bike has entered the municipal emblem, but it is the only villa in this kind in the whole Highlands.
They have a similar element in the emblem in honour of local technical monuments, for example, in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in Vyškov, Kuželov na Hodonínsko, Partutovice in Přerovsk or in the Police in Vsetínsk.
No offense, but I don't know Lafata, the prop Tripoli Goian admitted.
"I remember the game against Slavia very well, even my goal, like everyone in my career," the 34-year-old Goian smiled at the pre-match press conference.
Georghe Hagi was coached by us at the time, it was a shame we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta now.
Only that we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
It is this man who played 60 matches for the Romanian national team that is a key backer for the Greek team.
As a hitter he will face the raids of the Spartans offensive.
A few thousand people come, no hell, says Spartan Hybš of the Greek duel.
And he's partly in the idea of what he might be in for him on Thursday night.
I know well Fataie, who played in Astra, Romania, with my brother Luciano.
I saw all their fights at the time.
I know he's a very good striker, that's why he went to Sparta, Goian said.
He did not appoint other Prague club footballers, so the direct question came whether he also knew David Lafatu, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and pointed slightly at the Czech journalists.
The helpless look on his face said, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of the silence he began.
We've seen some videos and I've noticed that Sparta is playing a lot of team.
He's got really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone else but Fataie.
The Spartans know that very well of Goian.
"He has experience from bigger clubs, you can say that he holds the defence of Asteras, he is kind of their organizer of the game," observed Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian has already had his best years, but he boasts a very interesting football résumé.
At one time, he was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, but from Steaua he headed to the Italian Palermo, and played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We are expecting an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta are a big team, playing European Cups regularly, in a fight to win the Czech league.
For me he is the favourite in this match, but we play at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in a room with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košick, who is very much looking forward to his opponent from the Czech Republic.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering joining the Prague Stock Exchange.
Kofola should have a new headquarters in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading in the company's shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary objective is to have the group's headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far in the project are largely legal and administrative and have no de facto impact on what is happening in the company, says Daniel Burush, the Kofola Group's finance director.
"In connection with the transfer of the seat of the group, shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to its entry to the Prague Securities Exchange, the company is finalising a security prospectus, which it will present to the Czech National Bank for approval shortly.
The transfer of the holding's registered office and the related share transfers will be made in the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders participating in it.
As part of this operation, no shares will be offered to the public or new investors.
"Any offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so decide - at a later date, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016," the firm said.
The firm has previously stated that any share offer could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of a stock market offer in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of the shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of Czech Television's objectivity in reporting on the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of reporting by the main Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time the broadcast of the main news bulletin of Czech Television.
And how did she stand?
When they teach at the Journalist Faculty about how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today's broadcast to Czech Television Events.
The migrant crisis was devoted to about 80% of the news broadcast.
Except for the first minute, when TIME reported the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and called the migrant attacks on the police officers euphemistically their patience - throwing stones and attacking metal poles), the current promigrant propaganda - judge the names of the individual stories.
Criticism of NGOs - a large space for nonprofit organisations that criticise the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - a story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Going to refugees - Czech Television consistently uses the terms by a refugee or a refugee and not a migrant.
What is particularly pardwling is that TIME in the illustrative footage uses consistently only and only footage of small children and women.
At the same time, she herself said on the same broadcast that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic were men.
Summary: For the most part, the propaganda, which is unprecedented from communist agitators.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I got up for the apartment block once, I soon ceased to be the only resident.
The Formica toilet was moved into my fish.
Pond-fishers, insects with an imperfect transformation, i.e., not making the transformation from caterpillar to be a bucket and a cub look like an adult, only tiny and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me and I wasn't lazy to kill them.
First by hand and later chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some kind of blue crystals to eliminate them.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
But it eliminated them successfully.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in the same way.
A box with a kind of juvenile-sail, brought to the nest by the ants and he then did not allow the Queen to generate new offspring.
But I digress.
As time went on, the insects became the object of my admiration, and I became increasingly inclined to think that they had the same right to life as we humans did.
In addition, I took away from my life the experience that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can be replaced by another.
Truth with flea and bedbugs I might not hesitate to make it worse to kill karma.
In the new home, my partner and I agreed that if the fish didn't climb our necks, let them eat their renegade-skin chips in peace, some invisible algae, that sort of thing.
Their peaceful existence was disrupted by the spider after a time.
It was a common kind of covetskem who had long resided on the ceiling.
We thought he lived on the occasional fence and mosquitoes, which only made us more comfortable.
Having lived with us for several years, we found that he made a living mainly for the fishies and that he had apparently kept their numbers in a manageable numerical state.
Confidential, with a regular contact with each need made, we found out that it was a female.
For we have witnessed romantic courtship with a partner about a third less, carefully strums on the fibers of cobwebs so that he is not eaten before reaching the desired kicking.
It took about three days, when they didn't move and didn't even respond to our checks.
Beneath the toilet bowl where the love games took place, we later found the remains of the dried-extinned male next to the female.
Then the spider did not move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of small spiders hanging in the vicinity of her.
Soon they disappeared.
They were eaten by their mother's piece, scattered in the piece.
Even the female disappeared somewhere after a week.
Whether she went elsewhere or passed away, we don't know, but after a month, two, she appeared on the ceiling again.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the toilet-habited.
For a time, she watched our behavior cautiously from the ceiling, moving under the toilet bowl to assess our non-aggression as a friendship.
The numerous condition of the somewhat-spaned fishes had decreased again, and the spider was in peace with his normal activities to provide food.
For a year, our ecosystem hasn't changed.
Our daughter, in between, came to an age when the use of the potty was a disgrace.
We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal pouring of its contents has already been spiced up.
We urinised her more and more emphatically to use the toilet.
But her daughter, to maintain her habit, found an excuse in that spider she could see very well when wiped.
Our talk about seeing the spider was not taken by luck in the house at all.
Crying and roar, she forced her potty.
No alternative.
There was a moment when the spider had to be ordered, in the interest of the daughter's developmental shift.
It's left for me.
He was captured in a glass and banished across the balcony to the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt disgusting after living together as long as I were firing a relative.
We assumed that the fish would start to appear more often and start to multiply geometrically.
You marvel, a week, two, there wasn't one there.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I wondered if the spider had somehow grown there, following the example of ants, that the setting of the toilet was not as favourable to their existence as we had thought.
But then the first pieces of medium-sized appeared, and they were swarming again.
I had to think of a different theory about the cause of their disappearization, and I discovered that their link to the spider must have been the cause that if they didn't see it, that it was hidden in some other place, and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, perhaps they had some telepathic connection to their predator, and his quick disappearance sparked some alarm.
All the more so because I have no illusions about their eyes.
They showed some light of shyness, but that they would react to the wave of hands or quick movements, no.
My daughter already goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten about the potty.
All that remains is to attract a spider again.
I'm already sending my wish on the air, and I hope they didn't give up on me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use the Cyclone B.
A ten commands by Albert Einstein, which enriched the world.
The statements of a brilliant scientist from the last century will probably never cease to be fascinated by mankind.
He could dive so deep into everything that the figment was always astonishing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He came to the consciousness of the people primarily with his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic ratio.
It is also not to be forgotten to clarify its photoeffect or the idea of quantifying the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the descriptive and the system of insights of the popular theory of relativity is so hugful to many that it prefers to choose easy analogy for closer acquaintance.
But it is not easy.
Of course, it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this, too: The hour near your lover seems a minute; a minute in a hot furnace seems to be an hour - and that's relativity.
I took the liberty of his plethora of glorious quotes to choose the ten that literally captivate me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, the brilliant people try not to do them.
Only two things are endless.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not entirely sure about the first one.
No amount of experiments can ever prove that I was right.
But the only one can prove at any time that I was wrong.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break up an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in the mind, then what does the empty table reflect?
I don't know what's going to fight in World War III, but in the fourth, it's the sticks and the stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and to know much, too.
If I had an hour to handle a problem on which my life would depend, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes of analyzing it and 5 minutes of solving it.
In the world the hardest thing to understand income tax.
Finally, I can't help but mention the Einstein formula to the definition of success: Taking A for Success, the formula: A=X+Y+Z, where X is a job, Y rest and Z is to keep his mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are facing changes worth 1.5 billion.
"It is a success, considering that all four of them are holding in the black for the whole of this year," said the Governor Stanislav Mišák, a satisfied one.
The total profit of the regional facilities at the moment is about 32 million crowns.
The share of this is mainly due to higher reimbursements from insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
This, too, shows that, after years of poor years, hospitals can finally afford to make more investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, this is due to the construction, which together will cost almost CZK 1.5 billion.
The long period of our purchase of mainly appliances is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because you can't do top-quality health care without them, the plans were made by the regional deputy health care, Lubomír Nečas.
They look forward to the changes in all hospitals.
The builders will come to the hospitals as early as next year.
In Vsetín, they are now collecting suppliers of a new internal pavilion for almost CZK 300 million.
In Kroměříž they have a scheduled addition of dialysis.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new internal room for about 200 million to this year's open central pavilion.
And the Zlín Bata Hospital is awaiting the long-delayed construction of a new central intake and internment, which will require three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are the fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and doctors," said the director of the hospital, Věra Prousková, for example, on the construction of the Vsetín intern.
The five-storey building is due to be ready in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for both internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care units.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which will be recognized by patients in particular, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many of the sick lie in one room, on the floor they have even one toilet, the beds are unmovable, the windows are leissees and the paramedics do not have the appropriate conditions for work.
"For example, our internment was built thirty-five years ago and is now on the edge of its lifespan," pointed out the director of the Zlín hospital, Pavel Calábek.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected to the emergency reception.
Doctors and patients will thus have all the acute wards in one place, in addition to the new premises.
The same model has already been half-finished by Uherské Hradiště.
The central income is already standing and there will be an internment within three years.
"We will pay for the construction from the loan and partly from our own funds," explained director Petr Sládek.
It is this hospital that can be the only one to afford the county's own funding.
Profit is still the highest and it did not make the loss two years ago, when, for example, the Zlín hospital was struggling with a nearly two-hundred-million-dollar loss.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase revenues and manage the costs in the whole hospital effectively," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Improvements will also be reached by patients at the Kroměříž hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will go to repairs, new devices and reconstructions.
Already this year, the repair of the detention centre will be ready, then the addition of dialysis will begin, or the construction of the building for a new MRI.

No one has explained to me how I should keep the refugees in the country in the country when they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains after talks with his European colleagues that other states are pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but reject any discussion.
He also notes that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep the allocated refugees in the Czech Republic when they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We did not receive a response, so we wanted the quotas to be dropped from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you specifically describe the position you came up with at the meeting of the European Union's interior and foreign ministers?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot function.
We cannot refer to migrants as sacks of salt or flour.
They're living beings who have visions, they're going somewhere, they've got some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we were able to keep the migrants on the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine it.
We did not get the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be dropped from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, that is, registration points, border control, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we've been saying this is the way.
But to say the quotas will solve everything?
Not long ago we were dealing with forty thousand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in that territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people who cross us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants to come to us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country are coming to us the ambition to us, but the interest of the people from this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is limit-close to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees didn't really want to come to us, but we've already pledged to take in fifteen hundred people.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept more of them this way?
We are committed to accept 1,500 people, but with a condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border security, military operation.
Even for the 1,500, the point is that there are 1100 people to deal with with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility, and we'll treat them in the same way we've picked up.
It is a big question, and we will debate that with Europe, whether we can detain the people who are registered in Italy and Greece, or in Hungary.
Because Europe is treating this in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That means they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is a deal that is not yet there, it may be that we will not even keep the 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will leave after arriving for that Germany again.
If we can detain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will deal with them the asylum procedure.
If they are citizens of Syria, Eritrea, are almost 98 per cent of them, according to European statistics, gaining international protection.
Then they will be given documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will be moving.
This is the second project that has been under way, and we have only progressed there in the fact that we are debating with the churches about the possibility of helping them to get jobs, accommodation, and so on.
But that's a very long shot.
You said that at the ministers' meeting with us, the other states were unwilling to discuss.
But isn't it the case that the Czech Republic is merely rejecting quotas, but offers no solidarity step to unblock the discussion?
And what exactly do you think this is the solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany makes an incentive for all migrants from Syria to reach them, the news is spreading for hours across all camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It is the next wave of migration that is heading to Germany because they simply do not want to come to us.
We think the way is to protect the external borders - just to discourage the migration waves, to help those in need, and to separate economic migrants.
They clearly let them know they don't stand a chance.
Last year alone, fifty thousand Kosovars came to Germany.
From a safe Kosovo where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecution.
If we could have separated them and not accepted them or received them only according to the needs of the economies, the fifty per cent of what social systems are making to them in vain today could go to the refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced checks, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
It's eighty now, the first day it was twelve.
How far is this to get border controls to tighten up?
We were afraid of catching hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred vacancies in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we deter will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We do it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who take those people from us, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - that's a completely useless story.
So where is the tipping point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days will exhaust our capacities enough to take on contingency plans.
Then I am agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
Should the situation arise, the government can sit de facto immediately and by one resolution decide to strengthen the police on the military, say, the customs administration, or the prison service.
The extreme option is the state of emergency, which has been announced by Hungary in some places?
I don't think it can come to us this far.
Keep in mind that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen to this happening in the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarms.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, we have, suggests more that Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be very marginally affected, almost not at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of the debts at the last minute.
It seeks to prevent bankruptcy.
Soccer Slavia paid the debts.
The footballers also got their money.
Slavia Football stood in court for the first time on Tuesday for the insolvency proceedings.
Almost three months after the proposal to be made by the company Online Services of Pacific Samoa for around CZK 20 million.
Slavia's attorney, Zuzana Mládková, tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlová within a few hours that she should not declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
And it must be said that she made the arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the week before last, the new owner of Slavia was the large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC, as well as the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Apparently, money from the new owners arrived at the club, at the last minute.
This is also evidenced by the comments of Slavia before Tuesday's court hearing - the Vršovice club sent tens of millions of crowns to the due on the day before the court hearing.
"Em-everything was paid for between 9/11/at and September 15," said the solicit representative Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, to the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan or the Czech midfielder Mario Liček.
Slavia also paid the fee to the agent, Alexander Losenick.
Already on Friday, the club also paid the owed fees due to the Prague 10 district.
As a result, de facto, only the claims that Slavia contradicts the insolvency dispute remain a de facto.
Either the club did not make the commitments at all, or they are litigant.
However, we are prepared to pay the sums in the event of a loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in a bank account, which we can provide with an account statement," Mládková, the lawyer, told the judge.
"Enous of what was overdue is paid for," Mládková said, adding that unpayable or contradicted liabilities are not only unpayed or contradicted.
It is also certain that the judge will not make the decision in the next few days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the debts in question.
Subsequently, all the evidence will be appraisal.
The decision can therefore be expected in November at the earliest.
The judge ordered the continuation of the hearing on the third of November.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but only in writing after it.
Medals for the Finals and Austrians.
FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of inverto welding sources.
The combination of cutting-edge technology, hardware and software equipment integrated into modular design brings benefits and a quick return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final set-up is always configured to the customer's requirements.
Any of that, from welding of structural steel to welding special alloys, as well as welding coarse materials to welding thin sheets, from apps in workshops to welding in shipyards.
The incredible amount of welding curves, simple settings and the expandability of the welding source allow you to respond quickly to a change of requirements, leading to a reduction in downtime, to the need to rebuild the resource and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with high-end welding processes, developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and welding quality.
Time is lost and there is no waste of material or the correction of faulty feasts.
There is flexibility, less downtime, more welding and higher profit.
It is this year's novelty, which premiered in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We greatly appreciate these honours, as they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers boast similar systems, but thanks to the difference in software and parameter management, FastMig X is one of the world leaders.
For those interested, the delivery times, which are around three weeks, are certainly pleasant.
In the Czech Republic, we have already made our first contacts, which will certainly be extended after the Brno trade fair.
We have been regular participants for over twenty years and our business results are almost always better after it than before it, stresses for ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, head of the Kemppi store in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final set-up is always configured to the customer's requirements.
Blanca was built in a way that didn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says the expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka was also safer to be mined, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built in such a way that there would be no two drops of soil in Prague's Stromovka, according to the production director of Satra, the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovič.
He said so on Wednesday evening during a press search of the tunnel.
But it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive, he says.
Drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel was mined more safely, but the cost is rising exponentially," Butovic said.
The conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, he said, yet the country fell just a few steps from where it began to be mined using a safer and more cautious method.
"If those measures had been used 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," said Butovič.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav, Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the weekly Euro.
According to the original intention, the construction was to cost 17 billion crowns.
Add to that the VAT, which has jumped twice over the construction period, you have twenty-one of the seventeen billion.
Add to that technology, land purchases and engineering activities, indexation and similar items, it's 29 billion, which is not that far from the 37, said Belohlav
That's what someone ordered and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone with new Apple update
The new operating system can be requested in Settings when you click on the "General" tab and choose the "Software Update" (mandotupization of the software).
When it is ready, your phone will offer you the option to download and then install it.
Some users faced a problem after installation, namely the error message "updating the software failed."
One solution to this problem is to wait for interest in the update to fend off, or to attempt it via iTunes.
The phone will guide you through the process of updating.
And that includes the need to uninstall the application to free up the site - but this will not be necessary, as Apple has reduced the update and also facilitated the entire process by using a special tool that will design the user's apps to delete and reinstall after the update is over.
Make sure your phone is charged before you start the update.

FedEx's mixed, cut fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in full-year profit forecasts due to low demand for freight and higher land division costs.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
This period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's stock fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings to be between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, a 20 ccent drop from the previous forecast.
Analysts had expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The downsized outlook comes on average by 4.9 percent despite the interest rate hike, which will take effect in January. 4 and the higher surcharges for land transport for heavy or large parcels starting in November.
The company said it was still expecting a rise in profit from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Board Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "presented a solid performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, which is about the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter, which ended in August 31. FedEx raised $6929 million, up 6 percent from last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks were expected to be $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in the senior international shipping in recent years, causing revenues in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping boosted the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, ground revenues rose by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger packages and your own insurance.
The Express Force recorded a higher income due to higher base rates, while profits fell in the cost store due to higher labour prices.
In pre-market trading, they fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150 an hour before the opening of FedEx shares.
They ended Tuesday with a drop of 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days sitting at the 27-foot-long Hubra mahogany table this week, and will decide whether the time has come after nearly a decade to raise the key interest rate.
Stompering above them at one end of the central bank's ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a U.S. mural.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to give the nation's economic interests over everything else.
The central bank has a double charge of Congress: to maximize US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwitly third term: financial stability.
And this third term of office could be the X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, on whether the US economy is ready to be triggered for shutting down from an unprecedented stimulus in the form of an almost zero-time short-term interest rate on the spot from the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows solid economic growth, recent turbulence in world financial markets could already be spooked by the cautious Fed to add volatility by raising its federal fund reference rate - or even no more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will first of all be the most important thing to watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse to not increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of the jitters in the financial markets.
About half of economists surveyed by Blomberg recently surveyed had anticipated a rate hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to hold the issue late, with a key indicator of only about 30% of the chances for an increase.
This would point to a stock market decline if the Fed raises rates, only if politicians soften the slump by promising that a further increase is not in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones' industrial average jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,55.
The rally was triggered by the expectation that Fed politicians would delay rates in peace this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would come as a surprise if the Fed raised rates now," he says.
If the Fed's politicians did that, "they'd have to go to the extreme in their program statement and hold the hands of the financial markets so they don't panic."
Other experts said that raising rates would reassure financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate of 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions to confirm the strength of the US economic recovery.
Yellen said that she expected a rate hike this year despite complaints from the Liberals, despite the summer, that more economic progress was needed.
Even though job creation slowed in August, the labor market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage profits showed signs of a lift.
And while inflation continues to run below the central bank's 2% annual target, Fed policymakers say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "messes up with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics' senior economist.
But financial markets around the world began to froze late last month after China devalled its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones fell to 16% below its record highs in May, fearing that China's slowing economy would drag down global growth.
The market has bounced back somewhat this month, and Dow is now only losing almost 10% of the May maximum.
The Fed's political officials are provided by the troubled market situation with a comprehensive calculation to factor in an interest rate hike.
"In the absence of what happened in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about the impact it's going to affect the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main interests, so it should not technically be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint of then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "try" their monetary expansion in the market has sputhed out into the market.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly closely linked, Fed officials can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but are also consulting other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global wealth-management strategy of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "Fed has a history of overreacting to financial-market movements that appear unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policy-making of the Federal Open Market Committee, which pushed for a rate hike, cited the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its reference rate by 0.75 percentage point over the three sessions "Despite the limited identifiable impacts on US growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed the cuts.
The Fed should favor concerns about financial stability only during a major crisis, such as the market collapse of 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England's Rate Committee.
The latest upheaval is not even approaching this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of a rate rise because the markets have become upset," said Stoman, President of the Institute for International Economics, Peterson .
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinatown
The market/station was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
It is often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinatown and not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/goods are the only contact point to offer a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, a popular Thai and Asian refreshments, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part available if you need a little engine oil.
The store is massive and will take you over an hour to climb through all the aisles.
If you're hungry for all this shopping, go for a meal in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The interior trading booth (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various take-up points.
What's in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
In LAX-C, you'll probably find it.
Items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in bulk.
The fresh product gap includes special Asian and regional herbs, fruits and more.
The spread of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash and forgone for you, even fry it for you if you wish,
A good part of the shop is left to a massive freezer compartment, where you will find frozen kicle leaves, a bitter melon and galangal, entire ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork gut, fish balls, regional sausages, over-the-counter semi-finished products and more.
Who shops here: Restaurant and chefs' owners, also separate families and individuals.
Wide alleys reach out to shopping trolleys and forklifts.
Fale: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register stand.
Where it is located: The store is in an industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounding the suburbs of the Chinatown and the Centres - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own car park, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While a shop can be booked, parking is usually not hard to find.
The speed on the motorways will stay the same.
The acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the House.
On selected sections of motorways, it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed limit up to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
The House decided to do so on Tuesday when it acceded to the Senate's amendment, which rejected the increase in speed.
The amendment to the Road Act will now head to the President.
President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that he would veto the law allowing the 150-kilometre speed.
Transport Minister Dan Ťok (for ANO) was also opposed to the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built for such speed.
Ťok supported the Senate's version of the bill in front of MPs on Tuesday.
The approved amendment will now allow, in line with the government's original proposal, to increase the speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first class roads, in particular four-lane roads.
The House first extended this option to highways, which could be driven at speeds of up to 150 km/h in selected sections, but the Senate refused.
Members have now agreed to his proposal.
The senators, with the approval of the Minister of Transport, also took the authorization of the traffic police to have the final say in the modification of local roads, which are cared for by municipalities.
The Senate version, which the House approved, also envisages that the sewerage, water pipes or public lighting cables could be stored lengthwise under the road surface.
Municipalities would thus save on the purchase of the land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of the road vegetation along the local roads, regardless of the owner of the land in question.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to deal with towed vehicles that owners do not subscribe to.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles that their owners will not claim within the six-month period of the towing notification.
Municipalities will have the possibility to exclude transit freight traffic through their territory on second and third-class roads under the threat of a fine for forwarding firms.
The amendment also cancelling the possibility to introduce electronic vignettes instead of the existing paper ones, which will be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The Ústí ex-mayor goes to trial.
He faces 10 years of overpriced welcome to the citizens.
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced project to welcome the citizens.
The police also wanted to prosecute MEP Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not issue it.
According to the legal qualification of the case for both of them face up to ten years in prison.
The trial is scheduled for two October days so far.
According to the public prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused at least one million crowns of damage, according to the indictment.
The applicant relies on an expert report.
Former members of the city's management, according to the plaintiff, wrongfully allowed the financial advantage of the company that organised the welcome of the citizens to be acquired by virtue of their role.
According to the indictment, Mandík instructed the then head of the Municipal Department of the Municipal Services, Education and Culture to address five linked companies in the selection process.
When another company that offered the lowest price entered the competition, City Hall canceled the contest.
The contract was then to be entrusted to the administrator by the city, and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded the contract by the city council.
The city paid out at least an extra million.
Both accused were led by the aim of ensuring for Darothore the award of a public contract for the organisation of the Welcoming of the Citizen event in Ústí nad Labem in a long-term and coordinated manner at least in a coordinated manner with the request for the procedure for the care of a proper householder, the prosecutor writes.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that Darothore would then, after obtaining the contract, order Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcoming of the Citizen's event a price which would be disproportionately increased compared to the fair value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the file, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project.
The city eventually paid out only one part, roughly CZK 1.7 million, then byddle it from the contract.
The amount paid, according to the expert's report, was at least one million crowns overpriced.
Mandik had previously refused any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this contrived case, the former mayor said earlier, noting that the city under his leadership had only followed up on a similar project from previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the event was provided by Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mandík added.
Criminals initially wanted to charge MEP Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the Chamber of Deputies did not issue her to prosecute.
Criminals have therefore postponed the case in her case, but are counting on charging Kail after her parliamentary mandate ends.
The welcome of the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
The mothers received a gift check for CZK 5,000 for the purchase of children's supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police officers allegedly dropped a dog on the fugitive.
Then they made the press delete the footage.
Hungarian police are said to have briefly detained an AP cameraman at the border with Serbia and forced him to delete a footage of a police dog allegedly hinting a fugitive.
But the Hungarian government is challenging this accusation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday evening when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the border with Serbia through a cornfield near the Hungarian city of Röszke.
Police officers crammed against the refugees, and one of them had a dog with a basket attacked by a Syrian with a basket on his nose.
The dog of the man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," Muzi says.
The fact that Muzi was filming everything was not noticed by one of the police officers and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist was then no longer allowed to call his superiors or his colleagues on the spot.
Officers took Muzi to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then he was ordered to delete the footage.
Muzi thus lost the result of two days' work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a protest letter to the spokesman of the Hungarian government, Zoltán Kovács.
In it, she called the behavior of the police officers unacceptable, stating that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and having to worry about the government destroying the legally obtained material.
Kovacs, citing the police report, disputed Muzi's account of the events.
He said the officers just wanted the press to show them if they were in some of the footage, which they said they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to delete anything.
"Drinks can bark - they're trained to scare off and scare a little, but they didn't attack with certainty," Kovács says.
The unpredictable Champions League.
A win at City kicking us, Juventus believes
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of the home City.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team made many opportunities, but we had the ball on the kickers longer.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team had picked up a competitive match after a long 636 minutes.
It was the finalist of last season's Juventus who was in the opposite position before the clash - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, he has only a point as the defending champion and is 2-4 at the score of 16th place on the table.
So, too, the turnaround at the Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick in," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three props - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal - before the new year.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Mandzukic and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is terribly important, hopefully we'll take the winning streak thanks to him," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we rank among the best teams in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the attacking phase.
This result is due for my players.
"Before our equaliser, we could have scored 0-2, but Gianluigi held us up," said the goaltender's coach, Allegri, to Buffon.
"We burned some good chances," said Yayu Touré, the City midfielder.
We have to take our experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Goodbye Angela, farewell to old Germany II.
Before we go on about the issue of immigrants, we should be aware that the whole media froflesgue around is run by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop by for a second.
Today, the newspapers and the media are full of babies who are carried on their hands by their parents on the dusty roads of the exodus.
And this automatically evokes in a person - that is, a European man - a sense of guilt and compassion.
Well, they're not just the desperate kids coming here, you'd notice in the footage of the boats landing to the Greek islands that the kids aren't so visible on them!
Well, somehow, the pictures of the ships heading to Lampedusa, the refugees from the French border at Menton, have disappeared from the TV of the TV lately.
Much of the young blacks.
Also, the pictures have disappeared from Callais, where these eatings and black men wait to see if they can crawl through the tunnel under the La Manche.
I don't think it's hinged.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans did not impress the people of Europe in any particular way.
Too much of it was a falseness.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it is somehow concealed that it is not only about the unhappy children of Syria, but also about the out-of-the-moron - for the elders: fashionably frilled - young men.
Won's musculatura looks like they're just out of a fitness center.
Only one personal experience.
This summer, on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus, we lay on the private beach of the hotel.
Regardless of the fact that it was private, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no hams.
And young blacks stepped out of them.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30.
They entered the beach, all dressed in designer clothing and shoes. In their hands, of course, smartphones.
They were not interested in the private beach, and the employees - the Turks, the Muslims! - were evidently afraid of them.
They took all the cripple.
Whoever wasn't lying on it and was in the sea was unlucky.
They were dressed as an American rapper's movie.
On the heads of a hat with a nail, white and colored adidaska on the legs.
Then they put on a local beach bar and began to feast.
They took the tables around, crammed in beside the sitting swarthy and white guests of the bar - read to the Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled the dining terrace to somewhere quiet.
Incoming blacks drank beer from the thirds - the way they threw empty bottles around on the show from the USA?! - on the beach.
They kept yelling loudly at each other.
It was not in English, of course.
Then they went to drink wine, also straight from the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel's swimming pool - in designer swimsuits, especially the young ladies - screaming and screaming in the water, the mothers and the pensioners fled in horror, and half an hour later, not a single black guest was on the beach or in the pool.
They all disappeared.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were even afraid to talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a low voice that night, "Did you see the gold that they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," the waiter said.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had a massive cross of gold on his neck, like, a 20-centimeter.
And the women were a jewelry store.
"Are they drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You've seen them drink," the waiter replied.
Drugs are not smug or used.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I could see what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105, it was not so important to me.
I had no idea what was coming next.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they don't know.
At the time, about 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe.
And they go and go and go.
Today, the European Union's main problem has emerged, is that totalitarian-political-co-rectalted politicians, as if the intellectuals and their associated lobbying and economically important groups have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - the now publicly recognized major force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only them, the EU's and television leaders, including ours.
For example, recent TV pictures about the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of the pictures of Moscow's August 1968 television.
Sure, there were a few sun-worsheards at the station, but most of all - the old-fashioned - the Muslims welcomed their soukmen.
For weeks, they babbled on the news on Czech Television, as the Germans said were almost all for the arrival of the emigrants, according to some research.
But who was only in Germany for a few days knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which is confirmed by more information.
For example, the famous public opinion research organised by ARD - Czech for the Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take in even more refugees a week ago.
That's what our TVs melded.
However, they concealed what the next day burst in Germany: that the poll vote on the article showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer wanted any immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the poll.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly said in November 2010, five years ago,: "Our efforts at 'multi-culti's society have totally failed.'
She went on to say, "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All efforts to live together have totally failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, she says, a strategy that has allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live alongside each other without integrating has come to work with us. Today, they live here with us, and we lied to each other for a while, that they would not stay, that one day they would disappear again.
But that is not reality.
A multicultural approach, where we tell ourselves that we just live happily side by side, so this approach has failed.
He failed completely.
But even Merkel probably doesn't have the power to go up against the powerful Germany and of Europe and, above all, against political correctness.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euroněmec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, SPD MEP, the only one who reportedly does not even have a high school diploma in the European Parliament - yes, that is the one Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play a supervisor in a concentration camp - has shown himself, as he has done more than once.
It seems, especially under the impression of the latest statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, except for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that were victims of Nazism are horrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, the successful and solid Germans?
Who have spent years trying, at least on the outside, to deal with their terrible past of the aggressor and the murderer of millions?
Are those who say that it is the devil of aggression, superiority and violence to sow in the soul of Germany?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when, with all his strength, he stopped the efforts of the Greater League to take over the entire centre of Europe?
When did he say that the Grand-German idea would be destroyed by Germany?
I think he did.
When it was shut down, the preparations for World War I began.
The idea of the Greater Germany, which led the Germans and Europe to two wars costing millions of lives, is likely to have returned in a different form.
After the Marxists' attempt to dominate the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology, on the basis of, for example, ecology, which was, by the way, one of the main ideological Nazism ideas, began to develop.
We'd say sunshine.
The German elites have long defended the emergence of German nationalism, leaving in the room of all those fighters against the atom, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our Forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people who want to do something differently and better everywhere, they have fully sided with the fighters against the warm-heating of the planet, stopping nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic current, which considers all the Slavs a difficult verse - since the time of Karel Marx, who, after his parents, was mainly a German nationalist after his parents.
Also, as the latest statements by Schulz and the German minsters openly threatening the disobedient eastern states, the idea of a leadership-mining Germany, show.
Which must be listened to without a talk.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And when we include in the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And, as always, the capital, is behind this, especially the German one, which is, and which is that Germany actually controls most of Europe's states through the banks and the Union.
The pseudo-sinters first took the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multiculturalism, and today it brought home to them and will bring in perhaps millions of Muslims.
Who, who, the voices of the siren, will soon come across the wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see and start to rebel.
Germany can only threaten its neighbours with strength again, again a part of its population - but it seems, a smaller part of it can be sexually off, but in the end, as always, it is to be caught up in the first bit by reality.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim hostels are already burning.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the incoming Islamists erupt out?
To help them come to the aid of Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time, but certainly not assimilated to take over the local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalized Muslims, the incoming Islamists and the Germans, watching the Islamization of their country with fear?
What will this do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when the people who will loudly and publicly protest against the new Euro-supermor Muslim are raised?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict that has triggered in Europe by supporting a sunshine ideology, an elitist and essentially totalitarian ideology, and its greedy banks, is growing.
And because of blunt conduct against the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbours, this cannot be all right.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of nosy vendors: scare them to death.
Just knock and the sturdy knocker flicker at you in a way that the weaker nature may not exactly withstand.
The revived head will wipe you down nicely and drive away the hardrike, accompanying (or rather more likely to drive away) a persistent seller and an animated sculpture.
Perhaps it is a pity that a talking knocker cannot be purchased in reality.
Even with us, it would be useful to ban a lot of exciters and scumbags.
Pinked chic tale (Oxalis corniculata).
A small weed that tolerates a dry environment.
And so he is located among the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On 16 September 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that is one of the expansive weeds, but visually creates a nice impression when it comes to flowering.
Among the outdoor tiles is located.
She's unpredictable, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes drier environments, is easy to adapt, modest and undemanding.
It creates leaves with a chaotic composition, but it is worth observing and continuing to take pictures.
Below the small-scale light is the beauty of the detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with a purple accompaniment.
Brazilian paediatrician Rio Grande promotes healthy diet while breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric company SPRS came up with a shocking way to try to give women knowledge about the importance of a good diet in breastfeeding with pictures of children sucking from the breaststroke painted by the depiction of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give infants all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
With an excess of energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic creation of their children and protected them from tumor development.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the rates, though Nine's is attempting to take charge on the Today Show
The run-in of Karel Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the cost of the aftermath of the liberal leadership's escape failed to produce a sufficient increase in the rating for Today.
The morning's Nine show projected from national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull's Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with host David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This distance's a long distance tyranny did not seem to matter so much to viewers of Aussie TV, as it averages of 397,000 viewers in five capitals compared to 330,000 viewers of the Today broadcast.
Today saw a smaller increase in its rating compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their figure was past Thursday (343,000).
Today has been filling the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, there was an average of 318,000 in the Today, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the start of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
Sunrise averages 349,000 viewers so far in September, and Today has averages 314,000 viewers.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of the changes are affecting more this morning than just parliament, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with former star Packed to the Rafters by Eric Thomson.
A new drama about a recently-skin-nonee-shaped father who decides to move with his two children to the seaside part of New Zealand has an average of a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself could tighten a TV hit without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result gives a clear "yes."
Seven's X Factor retained a strong 1.136 million viewers, beating The Block (8380,000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded a mixed ratings for the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV queer (from 5 p.m. to 5 p.m.), as staged by Andrew O'Keefe's averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 5:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.) jumped to 633,000 spectators - enough for Eddie McGuire's small victory over Hot Seat.
On Monday night, the first half-hour The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 spectators and the second half an astonishing 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to a drop in the second-night standings of The Chase Australia, Nine will be convinced that the Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dolar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three in the finals, agrees that Bachelor's Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who does he choose?
The secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently found out who would win Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is shrouded in insurmountable mystery.
And the three girls who remain standing will certainly not reveal who the one who is the one who will receive the rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they involkly told us who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut by Thursday into Thursday's final
All three women singed lyrically for why Wood was the perfect man, quoting his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as the reasons they would like to be his partner.
Anyway, with the question, "If not, which gets Wood's final flower?," their answers might have worked as a link to whoever wins Bachelor's heart.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows, Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one best suited to Wood in addition to them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared a light relationship from a certain day.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched the energy of Sara and Sam, I felt they were pretty compatible and I still think so during the course," Jeavons-Fellows says.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They are comfortable and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood might be a nice couple.
For her, she claims that during his last visits to her home, she realized that Wood might be "the right one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this isn't just a game anymore - I've opened my heart to him now," she adds.
I asked who Wood would choose, if not her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say it," she said.
I like both girls just as much - it's a tie between Snezena and Lana.
Bachalor airs Wednesday at 7.30 to Ten.
Originally released as the best Sarah for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to launch his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States, and a lot of teams questioned after his brilliant start to practice at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomasl, and it looks like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, doing the Australian rugbius league's converts on the first kick-off from the pitch in Tuesday's 20-3 win at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and take him into the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also continued to be honest in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing the rookies in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.
Tomsula was also supported by Hayne publicly at a press conference after the match.
The 49ers reporter, Cam Inman, said that Hayne also received encouragement from the special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and just take care of the next game.
Early in the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne made up for his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club were hoping for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was captured swearing when he left the field after a mistake and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 he couldn't imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's all," Hayne said
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when a recording in his own goal area led to Queensland's three-way.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo of the fans holding the Australian flag on her own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin to meet in discussion on gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested while pointed guns on the Siberian runway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his Yukos oil company confiscated and his democratic efforts restricted.
The ÚS stood up for the emigrants who sought the compensation of the property.
The pair emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, the property could no longer be returned, so the pair appealed to the state for compensation under the Law on out-of-court rehabilitation.
The court first awarded them the amount claimed, i.e. over CZK 2.8 million, but the appeals court changed their claim by awarding them only to less than CZK 90,000, referring to the amount of the compensation being determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
The emigrants were defended by the Supreme Court and tapped them the amount of the defendant.
However, the Ministry of Finance, which was to pay the money, turned to the complaint against the CPS.
In the meantime, such a change in social and economic circumstances has occurred that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at the time - although it was then compensation adequate in relation to the resale of the property - now amounts to only a fractional amount of the property.
"This cannot be the burden of the interveners as in the restitution of the beneficiaries, who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to obtain compensation before," explained Judge-Rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, explaining why the ÚS sided with the emigrants.
"The CPVO has repeatedly spoken in favour of the general courts proceeding in restitution cases in such a way that any inconsistency is not interpreted to the detriment of the beneficiaries and that the purpose of the restitution legislature, i.e. aton the atonement of the property grievance caused by acts of the former totalitarian state, is always achieved," the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studio DVA will now be played by Radka Fišarová.
Radka Fišarová, incidentally, became the world's youngest Evita when, in her twenties of her twenties, she played the role of the wife of Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech performance of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice at the Spirála Theatre in Prague.
Returning to the same role, he says: "To this end, the demanding nature of Evita has not been matched by much of a performance."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended for the role of the first lady of Argentina by Monika Absolon.
I've seen Moncha in Evita three times and it's certainly been inspirational for me.
This is where I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I am quite a fan of more modern adaptations, but this one is simply particularly hilarious.
"Ondřej Sokol's directorial is original, lightweight and contemporary," Fišarová says.
The imaginary handover of the musical sestre between the two singers will take place at Monica Absolon's Birthday Concert on September 27 at 7 p.m. at the Studio DVA Theatre.
The evening culminates with songs from the musical Evita.
The experiences will surely include a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (You will meet your cries, Argentina!).
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also take a break from the directing lectern, replacing Karel Roden as President Perón for the duration of the filming.
Due to public interest, further dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by the Studio DVA Theatre in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Directed by Ondřej Sokol, the female main role was originally studied by Monika Absolonová.
At her side appears Karel Roden as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenáčik.
The legendary songs by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovsky are performed by a live orchestra under the direction of Kryštof Mark, who was already involved in the first performance at the Spirála Theatre.
4 people killed after police fired rubber projectiles at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of demonstrators against the draft new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district officer, reports that more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station, with some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dhakal reports that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before they resorted to the rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he says.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber projectiles known for their ability to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, clearly caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the last week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have set up a new province under the proposed new constitution and have commuted their political influence.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which is demanding the creation of its own state.
As of August 10, at least 40 people were killed in violent engagements, including 11 police officers.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces - a big step towards the new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally run for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process following a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted in Kathmandu this week on the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We mustn't panic now.
After losing to the ice on the ice, the championship Litvínov, you didn't even manage a home duel with the Sparta players (3-5).
Aren't you worried about a similarly disastrous entry to the extras as you were a year ago?
I hope nothing like this will be repeated.

NHC predicts 60 percent probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands is likely to be 60 percent likely to create a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure system about the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles also has a 60 percent probability in the emergence of a tropical cycloon formation in the next two days, added the weather forecaster based in Miami.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said it was launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who flood European states fleeled war-torn and poor countries. Google will double each selected.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
The report was posted on her blog by Google employee Rita Masoudová on the basis of personal experience when she fled Kabul as a seven-year-old with her family.
"We have travelled on many dark trains and buses and have experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families, like that, are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among the 4 nonprofit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double all the posts made via google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the biggest wave of refugees since the Second World War. Most of them come from Syria in the throes of a four-year war that has driven 4 million people this year alone.
Many people are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be useful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"Movoron mortality data takes a long time to be depicted," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial for a new study of JAMA surgery.
Weager surgery, bariatric surgery uses different methods to shrink the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey was conducted on people with morbid obesity with a value of 25 or above.
BMI, which measures the weighted relationship in height, is considered to be normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values of 25 or higher indications of a person's overweight and people above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan use data collected from a study since 2007 on two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastronomic gastric bypass - in type 3 diabetes therapeutic procedures for people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those undergoing surgery has fallen from 31 to 24.5 towards the end of the fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment of diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was solved completely in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the medication-treated group, only 1 percent was completely resolved for the comparison of diabetes, and in only about 2 percent of patients.
Furthermore, a blood pressure check, trigylcerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were also demonstrated "in general to be better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's levels of haemoglobin A1c in the blood, which reflects the ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
The Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below the level of 7 percent, researchers say.
After the surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medication treated group, however, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glykemic control" - which is reflected in the better levels of the hemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality at the age of five, according to the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrektomy group (18.7 against 14.2 kg), achieved larger declines in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent against 2.1 percent) and were more likely to remise the diabetes (46.9 percent against 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, the obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent better chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried multiple conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, according to Blackstone, this is a reassuring result for BMI people below 35, who are interested in these procedures.
"Romatic work is critical of this work because it states that the surgery is safer in the lower BMI group," he says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also further argues that people and their doctors should start taking their weight seriously after the drop in the patient's BMI between the 27 and 30s.
"I think we've been waiting for too long to be showing people the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once, when these genetic changes, which will tightly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all refugees, said the Lama, and added that a genuine solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, a study of ethics, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that under the current circumstances, humanity's interest should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable it was, was inadequate in this situation for the refugee crisis.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in a solution to the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring about real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In dealing with the issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions against George Bush after 9/11 in a terrorist attack, claiming that "the US's violent response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent way.
I know his motives were good, but he used the power to create unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
A four-fold increase in the number of children who have been sanitized by a sanitation agent in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase from 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowed by a high-alcoholic ambulance agent, according to the toxicology center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia toxicology centre, the number of ambulance perilditis in children under the age of 12 who were reported to the poison inspection centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more often, and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink the remediation device intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or as a call on social media.
Videos on Youtube show teens drinking a sanitation device for cheap fuss.
The teenagers allegedly mixed the ambulance with the mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive scent of the resource.
"Children don't think about it hurting them," Lopez said.
A lot of more attractive (sanitational means) are those that are perfumed.
To be given are remediation devices with the smell of strawberry, grapefruit or oranges, which are very appealing to children.
The ambulance contains between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol.
In young children in particular, several swabs can mean alcohol poisoning.
"This is highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University of Kansas City's University of Kansas Hospital control director, told Fox 4.
You wouldn't let a glass of whiskey be lying around either, but people leave these ambulance remedies out there, and when the kids get to them, it's a quick road to alcohol consumption.
Nhaijah Russel, a 6-year-old girl who recently ingrained up to four sips of a strawberry-scented ambulance at the school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr Chris Ritchey, the emergency doctor who cared for her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah spoke the indistinct words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because of any signs of brain trauma because of alcohol, the girl fell and hit her head, Ritchey reports.
"It was very scary," Nhaijah's mother told CNN.
It could have been mortal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or arrange for ambulance to be out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation products were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a ambulance that contained a toxic, undeclarated ingredient.
Health officials believed the product contained methanol, a deadly reagent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York City planned to poison their "bad" teachers by deploying antibacterial products around the room," according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the ambulance and has forbidden their presence in the room.
Police assessed the thwarted plan as "innocent chatter," referring to the discipline of the school district,
Famar: No mismatch in the Celtic team
Griffiths downplays talk of mismatch at Celtic, while Deila admits that the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he reverses it again.
Hearts will battle the SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton is worried that the new reinforcements of January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
The first-half penalty in ADAMA's lead by Rooney gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, giving Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths denies talk of mismatch
This situation has sparked rumors of mismatch at Celtic, which have been denial of Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased surveillance in the run-up to the match with the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lackle in Scottish title rivalry bored with the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands stand-off Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no more rivalry between them because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently the ambassador of Ajax, states: "In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic's matches, and why?"
Because there's no more Rangers.
The people here don't just talk about the Rangers' return.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They talk about the two teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension at the Old Company matches and it is not only the people of Scotland who are watching these games.
I turn things back to the good, commits Deila.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was stumbling a bit, but the Norwegian boss pledged to turn things back to the good.
The defeat by Malm and the following out of the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now popped at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Cell's been through a bad time and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad with current events.
We're in exactly the same way - but we have to move on.
Really, we really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players much better.
It is very important now to stick together.
Warburton is concerned about January reinforcements
Despite comments that surfaced a few weeks ago and suggested that he had already identified some of his January targets, Rangers chief Mark Warburton is worried about the big shopping of reinforcements and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former Brentford boss states: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer's."
Players who come in the summer have the whole pre-season for the settlement, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes there's more damage by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Michu's transfer target hints at retirement
The Swansea Michu striker, who was associated with Celtic in the transfer window, indicated that he could retire after his contract with Swansea expired.
The 20-year-old marksman has been having trouble with a susceptible ankle for two years and has been unable to find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts to fight SFA for comments against Neilson
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the locker room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card for that defender was later cancelled - the third red card issued by referee Collum, who was dismissed.
Neilson stands by his statement and states: "I did not question the integrity, I did not comment on the performance."
Griffiths pledged to avoid Tynecastle
The stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting that he was singing a song with a lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Tynecastle derby in March of 2014
"This was a derby and it was a heated moment," the striker said, continuing: "I can safely say that I will not return to the Tyncastle unless it is in a Celtic shirt."
The Tannadice Council believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that Dundee United's board still believes in correcting the situation by managing the team today - but admits that the decline on the pitch must come to an end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the boys for action again," promises Donnelly.
MCInnes is happy for the 'anchor' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to hold desperately against Hamilton Accies to win a seventh consecutive league victory and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the standings thanks to a penalty from the first half of Adam Rooney's serve.
McInnes states: "There is no team that has won anything, cups or leagues, without winning this type of matches."
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged as UK overall unemployment rises
INSTRITORRATION in Scotland, the total of 164 000 in the period between May and July remains unchanged, while the total number of unemployed in the UK has risen by 10 000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the UK rate (5.5 per cent), as shown by data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over a three-month period, with the number of workers now halting to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell said in a commentary on the latest figures: "The long-term government plan has laid the groundwork for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we saw further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment was rising while unemployment was falling.
Why I witnessed an execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will be watching the man's death.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in the viewing gallery in the death chamber of Oklahom State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who will be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officials to witness his death.
I received the invitation first in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I'm beginning to be afraid of it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you of the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and, because there are often more requests than vacancies, a morbid lottery is carried out to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of posts for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch the entire execution dispassionate.
I can't do that.
I will sit alongside Richard Glossip's closest friends and form a special bond with him through the months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk.
The Prison Administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't have a notebook and I won't be able to record what I'm seeing.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way it's going to like, get access.
I was complaining.
She admitted that "it could have phrased this better," but still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the death penalty procedures.
Kim Bellware, the Huffington Post journalist, will be by my side.
To know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard the Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would have found him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there is a good chance that he is innocent of the murder.
I certainly believe that not enough evidence was provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is wrong.
It is from this perspective that I will follow his death.
I can't say I'll be really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love, to die an unnecessary death.
Man escapes from Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he freed the man from the Canning River.
The man's bet from Petrh that he would run away from the police did not come out after he got into the shallow muddy water only a metre from a policeman who tried to persuade him to return to the shore.
Canning Vale police were called in an incident spanning Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He was in the water and he kept saying I'm not going to go out, just come for me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhttac didn't exactly want to soak his uniform, so he tried to use safer tactics and the police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do funny things when you run," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a bus and try to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning Ben Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the organizers tried to spy on him and threatens to end the races
Peeter Moody accused the organiser of Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into the stable last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the organizer and integrity department of Racing Victoria, and was based on the belief that they had a late-turned campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late-scrapping maintenance day, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidara's positive ogre for a cobalt that he could not explain.
He bit the language about the espionage charge for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it's all coming out of you at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you respond and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going to go home today and have a good night's sleep.
I want to go up with my head and the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start to think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach.
I'd have to consider doing my license afterwards.
Previously, Moody launched a bomb in his race-script interview with racing.com that the integrity of the department had tried to spy on him.
"Eight-month months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with the man - whom I'm going to name after question - and offered him a job at my stables for finding out about the things that are being done in my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because they totally burned me in an attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former RVL chairman, David Moodie, current chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saundra, the current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of this today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Will the RVL grow a few sphee and arrange for people outside of coaching positions to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them material for reflection.
But I got to a point, since I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really made me sad.
I will press them and pass on the burden to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The level of the coach's frustration has been raised with a long-term investigation into cobalt, including Lidari, and the recent scratch has made him feel "catching his license on the table."
Mood, best known for preparing undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the treatment rule on the day of the race "laughing" after being applied to the horses' feet of clay cladding or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally applied mud to his leg.
He could've had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for cladding treatment on the day of the race, to which the organizers had already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need the rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram driver who fled arrest
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and left after a collision.
The cyclist was flown to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the main road Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with unstoppable accidents, failure to render assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back at rivals over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, Melbourne Storm's coach, criticized his players' interventions as "craising the plan" by two NRL favorites premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed the players to "refence" Storm players during the controversial Storm team's controversial victory in the Sydney Qualifying Final on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled remark to Stror after his team's team won the qualifying final over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a rugby rugby game and, according to him, two of Queensland were not "too great" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended the saves of his players and said they concentrated on "contacting."
Bellamy added that this situation has increased his confidence because his team is being criticised by two leading coaches, which may mean they are afraid of losing the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed any of our defensive systems and techniques in the last year, the last few weeks we've only put emphasis on contact during the procedures, and that's a turning point for us.
Trent's been here for three years and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things like that always come up in this one year.
Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "repectioning football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetov's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the premiership in 2010 by playing "nudit" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right about his Saturday play being as exciting as ours. It was also as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St. George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said at the time that he didn't give a damn.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that he finds to be canceling, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
You would like to play such football if you had this type of player at your disposal.
He said that view in 2010, and now he wants all the teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It gives me more confidence because they say things like that because they are worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think of us when they got to the big fights.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that there were more goals in the Storm and Roosters game than in the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos' game was probably good, I didn't look, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and no-go attempts interesting?
I think it's the agendas.
If they mention us, that means we will definitely meet again at the stage.
Storm are on a break this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man gets $200,000 bail for drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for holding 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled out of Queensland received bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29) was one of five men arrested by federal police last month for 100 kilograms of drug from the yacht Solay, who arrived from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted in a meeting with the accused in the harbor during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential sentence of life for owning commercial cocaine, Maksimov's lawyer set up the defence on the fact that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could be in the cafe completely by accident and innocence.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed Maksimovic would flee.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Mother and stepfather Maksimovic jointly offered bail $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the affidavit statements of both individuals, it is clear that the deposit of USD 200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts themselves were clearly insufficient because the accused did not appear further in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that she gave up both the Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police on a daily basis and abide by a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure paedophiles to send pictures
Paedophil used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then logged in to her online chat, where he had a lot of indecent photos of the children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found her phone missing and then found it in the hands of the sleeping Hogg.
She went through it and found disturbing news before alerting her mother.
Police joined in and saw five photographs, after which analytical computers found the address and discovered "dissatisfied" searches on the web using expressions for searching for naunous pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officers that his reason was to "take pedophiles" online before he "pretched he was a police officer and frightened them."
Fiscalsec Representative Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Sheriff, "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to people scaring.
He admitted that he did the computer searches, but he claimed he only wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them in
He claims he went nuts when he was drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When the girl found the messages on her phone, he called his mother, shivering and crying.
She saw the nauatcomy pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, while residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to suing to accept or provide inappropriate child images on June 14 last year, violated the terms of his bail on January 25 and did not appear for a court hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on the list of sex offenders because he can argue that there was "no major sexual subtext" in his actions.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the ruling to October for filing a social worker report.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody before hearing about other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sex offenders before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwean's Robert Mugabe gave a bad speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, had earlier fallen on the steps leading up to the stage this year.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall went viral in social media.
The opening of the parliament was also tainled by opposition legislators' claims that they had received anonymous threats of killing, warning them against the whistle of Mr Mugabe during his speech.
He was booed and provoked last month during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he reiterated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to hinder Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that will not appear, but is named 'death'," he told the journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and, once they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "obscurka" about threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is set to cut its job by as much as 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard the abolition of 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the cost of the company's commercial services.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies and will separate the computer and printer trade from its faster-growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected job cuts will result in a change in the size of about $2.7 billion and start in the fourth quarter, HP says in a statement.
"These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive, sustainable spending structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who will head the unit after the split.
"The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a wide and extensive business portfolio to help businesses move to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separated company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will be sent to the company's declaration of more than $650 billion in the company's annual income and "will be aimed at providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will set out the company set up by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the electrical equipment graduates from Stanford University in 1930, and whose Palo Alto garage was dubbed "the Silicon Valley chi Gradier."
HP was undergoing a massive reorganization to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical firms in America, is the latest in the sector based on the belief that a closely a specialist firm has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind the injured Jack Wilsher ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilsher that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason not to play again at Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least four more English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in the next European Summer Championship, is clearly uncertain.
The big pity for this newest problem is that Wilshere ended last season's strong after an ankle injury and then got back into his former form during the preseason.
"This kind of injury is not a threat to a career," says Wenger.
It's a blow that requires healing.
This is nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It was not about his ankles or injuries he had sustained before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, as Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injury whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
The survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Wilshera since he made his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has played in only 65 league games for Arsenál out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs to lose the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that the improvement in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you come back from injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time to strengthen your body and get a competition," Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will and he'll have a career he deserves.
Arsenal begin the campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and let the players in need let it out," says Wenger.
Even though Arsenal are the clear favourites to advance from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation for the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also not beaten in a total of 41 games after they kept up their "non-admountable" campaign last season.
The stadium rocked the 32, Richter earthquake on Wednesday night.
That was the 10th time this year at Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal have learned their lesson from last season's Champions League, when he capitulated against Monaco and remains a distant chance to lead the club to their first victory in the European Cup.
"This commitment is enormous," Wenger says.
Arsenale never happened.
We were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I have to be a realist.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of such views on various shows is blatant, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever when it comes to suicides among young men under 15.
This was the only largest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK in 2013 and remains three times more common in men as in women.
In an effort to address the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) called the 2015 Year of the Man, which aims to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help if needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies the friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study by more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the victim had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of sane sane friends is half the chance of occurring in mental health problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must be reachable first.
In this communication through social media with an emphasis on style and not the content of the message, the immediate answer is often favoured over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun-loving and more successful has doubled, even if we are more isolated in reality.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social condition, everything at the expense of our true values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire and game-maker explained not long ago, the money really doesn't buy better luck.
The beauty of Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, who shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, the moment of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stemming from the realization that, yes, men can also identify with it, even if they mostly keep their feelings to themselves.
as a Samaritan worker explained to me: ..."my role is the role of the listener of people who feel depressed or suicidal indeed confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage of "trans to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be seen as weak to open up to problems.
Friends are one of the shows that come up in my memory when I'm trying to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
He emphasises the short moments in a man's friendship.
As for my task, the state of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of desperation, but long-term support has to come from a larger near-friend, a network of friends and family.
So if you're going to FrendsFest this weekend, held by Comedy Central Station, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk, where the interior for the occasion of the celebration will be completely redesigned.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know the difference your friendship can make.
Friends will air on Comedy Central from start to finish - full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored to help PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored on his debut in the Champions League, helping PSG beat Sweden's Malmo team on Tuesday.
Here's the news of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a final comfort victory of 2-0 against Malmu on the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League and that PSG player sent the French champions to win, but then they threw away a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a head-kick in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their path to the quarter-finals, which they have recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it was not the classic performance of the team by Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was marrode in front of the goal and was later replaced against his home team and club, in which he began his famous career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win away or at home in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win is causing trouble for our opponents and looking comfortable in defence is a good start, even if there are things we will have to improve with the season progressing," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, yet I regret that we didn't shoot one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury as one of the three changes to the PSG team, which drew 2-2 with Bordeaux in the League this weekend at home, but was eclipsed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who would take PSG to a new level in Europe after last month's transfer from Manchester United and showed why, when he ran to the pass of Marco Verratti's defence and sent the ball behind Johan Wiland to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to kick-start a spectacular victory for PSG, they must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs to reach that stage, entered with 9 internationals in the starting line-up and five defenders, and two drawn-up midfielders were a tough opponent.
But apart from a shot from Nikola Djurdjice, who just missed the far corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they didn't offer much in the offense.
Instead, PSG themselves were striking for the benefit of the attack with poor passes and a lousy finish that was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who could not shoot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed as his shot was slampped into the net shortly after the start of the second half by Cavani.
However, he proved much more appropriate when it came to the preparation of the chances for his teammates and it was from his pass that Di Maria sent a draft shot that ended in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after the hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan header sent his sixth goal over the line this season after Ibrahimovic passed him on a pass from the left flank from Maxwell.
This ended all of Malm's thoughts about the possibility of making something of the match, and only an excellent save by Wiland from close proximity to David Luiz's hopes dashed and the score remained unchanged even when reliever Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal was not out of the question at the end of the game.
Coach Malmo Age Hareide admitted to the fact that PSG were a class above his team, the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
For them, it was a fascinating match.
Glencore made $2.5 billion in stock sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, which was hit by the collapse of commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion on Wednesday from the sale of shares as part of its large-scale debt-reduction plan.
Glencore says in its statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to repay the debt.
This company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is facing a denouction for commodity prices, as China's slowdown in the economy is reducing demand and sparking destruction across markets.
The issue of rights sent Glencore's share prices to the top in the London stock market in early-morning stores on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69 percent.
Glencore revealed last week that a $2.5 billion share sale is part of broader plans to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares at a price of 123 pence per share, marking a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They got rid of 1.3 billion shares, at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about prolonging the brakes on the rise of Chinese growth have cut the price of iron ore by nearly half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response from Barack Obama to a visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, the report said.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his spouse Peng Liyuan to a state dinner to be held after the talks.
"President Xi's visit provides an opportunity to strengthen relations between the US and China and urges cooperation to address the challenges of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for a constructive debate about the disagreements between the two states," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet with several US technical leaders on his way to Washington and then resume to New York at the UN meeting in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyberespionage and its mounting aggressiveness in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis shattered the Schengen area.
The emergency flare launched by Germany has far from blighted a European garrison, but is already forcing the ship to change course, the French daily Le Figaro reported.
The European Union decided on Monday to tackle the problem of refugees first: it will rather systematically classifies migrants and asylum seekers as soon as it sets foot on the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than arguing over the future distribution of refugees according to quotas based on the quantities, which is increasingly moving away from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the Member States made the home a priority.
Before taking care of the final destination of the refugees, it is first necessary to filter out those who are arriving today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential to manage migration," the text discussed by ministers in Brussels stresses in a text discussed in Brussels.
Following the crisis of the common currency, the EU is at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it is not losing its resolve and increasing pressure.
It is renewing border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in the country.
The central power is making it clear that without it, no free movement is possible in Europe.
It has already served as evidence that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying degrees of intensity.
Hungary had done so long ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under the Schengen rules.
That it is a domino effect is also seen by the blind.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry-on-checked checks in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas Maizière discussed this intensively during a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is being made up to stiff.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of the newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified by taking out fingerprints.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory because it is more afraid than others to keep the camps in which the refugees would pile up at its expense.
Greece remains a real black hole.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as have arrived in Italy recently.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge, binging hole.
Athens, which is still in financial disruption and awaiting a new government, has folded its hands into its lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan trip and the source of concern now for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises that the introduction of the checkpoints will take place as soon as possible, but has not given any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," agreed the EU's interior ministers on Monday to mobilise on the front.
So it is about deploying the European Border Control Agency's Frontex intervention teams in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its reception capacity for asylum seekers and strengthen the surveillance of the islands.
"Adequisal financial resources will be needed," the text submitted to the ministers for approval warrants warns.
In terms of law they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The question of the emergence of real European border guards has not been formally raised, but Europe is close to this.
The 28's new emergency situation, it has, as the second rail, pushed the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was raised by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament earlier in the year, strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained on Monday in a text approved by the majority of the 28.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm pledge includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, which was already reached in June during the hectic EU summit, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alpine, including three Czechs reportedly.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
Authorities also say the German nationality is the woman who was the only survivor of the affected eight-member group.
Previous media reports indicated that it was a Polish.
A woman in her 30s with a serious leg injury to her femur area was hospitalized in the city of Briancon.
The dead were mostly 40-year-olds, according to AFP.
"The rescue operation is over, the bodies of the victims were also taken for identification to Briancon," said the Prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department, Pierre Besnard.
The accident happened around noon in the mountainous region of Pelvoux below the top of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins mountain measuring 4015 metres.
"The high avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
The eight-member group, according to him, was pouring in an enormous amount of snow at an altitude of about 3900 meters.
The weather service did not warn in the area before the weather today.
Trengove before the match with Braga: Finally, a true Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, in his Championship opener in the cups, managed to make it through the pre-season of the Europa League to the group stage with the Liberec players and is now looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
The Slovan will welcome the 2011 finalist Braga to the start of the main stage of the competition and, according to the coach, wants to impose his playing style on her.
After all the nerves in the knockout stages, when every goal and every situation could knock you out on the way to the dream group, now we're there and we're going to play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal we're off, we can play our tactics and we're not bound by a double-header.
"I am very looking forward to it and it is a real Europe, before it was only qualification," Trpišovský said at a press conference.
Braga is considered a top team.
They will be very active, they have all Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may just be harder just because he doesn't have that name, but he has a player in his cadre who, I think, scored three goals for Manchester.
"He is an excellent team-level team," Trpišovský said.
But he does not consider Braga to be the clear favourite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not the outsiders.
"I think we showed in the domestic competition and in the preliminary rounds that we are strong in our stadium and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen from 11 duels this season.
He believes that Liberec can also impose its style on Braga.
We are going to have a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time it is uncharacteristically disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 set-up with a quick transition to the offensive phase.
"He is a very difficult opponent, we have discovered the weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the pitch," Trpišovský said.
We studied the opponent a lot in the pre-seeded rounds, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, to which we adapted the training sessions.
"And we definitely want to, although it will be very challenging to be played according to our notes," the coach added.
Student films will take over Sand, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries have entered their works this year for the 15th edition of the International Festival of Student Films in Písek.
Four dozen of them, sent to the final by a committee of students and educators, will be screened from October 15 to 18 at the Portyč Cinema.
The best of these will be chosen by an international jury, said festival spokesman Jakub Charvát.
Every year the festival has its own special theme, which is based on the festival's theme song.
This is a detective story.
The director of this year's gala evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre.
"And of course we also need to solve the crime that was committed in our trailer this year," said Charvát.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of the student's work - films of fiction, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, which will include last year's winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the festival's organizers prepare an accompanying programme.
The Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turbošanson band Poletíme?, playful band Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with a recital Life at the Bar.
The festival will also host two exhibition photographs.
The first will be brought by a graduate of the Sand Film School and a recipient of the prestigious awards, including the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ašenbrennerová.
The second exhibition will bring to a zoom in the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The cinematographer and documentary filmmaker Martin Čech will come to the sit-down with the visitors, the silent film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber and the sand natives Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of the sculptor Jan Novotný christen their new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we will also remember Miroslav Ondříček, the patron saint of FAMO in Písek, who left us recently.
Our school and the festival are his legacy that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences with each other and develop joint ties as well as film craft," the spokesman said.
The Pitching forum, where students can meet film professionals, will certainly help to do this, complete several job-selephased competitions at the same time and get a job.
The festival is associated with the creation of the Private Higher School of Film in Písek.
Its founders, the couple, Vladan and Miloň Terčovi, organised their first year in 1997.
The sixth year was held once every two years.
In the bankruptcy of the TA, insurance companies are to cover the clients' claims in full.
Insurance companies should cover the full amount of clients' claims for the travel agent's bankruptcy.
This was decided by the House on Wednesday when it approved a modified amendment to the Tourism Business Terms and Conditions Act.
Travel agencies will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee, according to the draft, which is headed for consideration by the Senate.
Insurance companies with the obligation to pay the claims of clients even above the agreed limit do not agree.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the adjustment, arguing for consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end the insurance of travel agencies against the crash if the amendment applies.
But the proposal has also been criticised by travel agents.
Without insurance, they will either have to quit or go abroad.
Minister for Regional Development Karla Šlechtová (for ANO) pointed out that the cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation were not eurocomform.
She drew attention to this year's Constitutional Court ruling, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, Šlechtová stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have a limit to be feasible," said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek.
The bank guarantee, according to him, will not work because no one will give it to the limit.
"Tour offices will have to cease their activities or move them abroad," Kalousek warned.
Member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies, Tomio Okamura (SPD), disagreed with Kalousek's concerns on the basis of a survey of member CK.
"Stop showing us lobbying insurance companies," he said.
The insurers' comments are not held by Okamura to be relevant, there is no official written statement to that effect, according to him.
But they are said to be looking to see if the travel agencies will take part-turfours, which Okamura says is not a problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS) also warned against the provision, referring to the opinion of the competing Association of Travel Agents of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who talked about the deletion of stairs to Czech travel agencies.
Travel agencies, according to Fischer, will not be able to take out insurance.
"The consumer protection is working," Fischer says.
Her proposal to launch the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Neither did Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) with a proposal to return the draft to the committee because of the alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Filip drew attention to the travel agencies, which he said could threaten consumers.
The draft's rapporteur, Martina Berdych (ANO), in the light of the Constitutional Court's verdict, withdrew her proposal, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not have known that the insurance benefit would not cover the full risk.
The amendment will not include the originally proposed minimum four million insurance limit for travel agencies that offer air travel tours and a million-dollar limit for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The boron will remain at 30 percent of the planned sales of the tours.
However, the insurance benefit limit will have to be such that it covers all customer claims in the event of a travel agent's bankruptcy.
The standard, even after the modifications, stipulates that the travel agencies will have to newly mention for the sold tours which travel agency organizes the trip.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies before the conclusion of the contract, among other things, data on the management and number of trips.
The approved amendment to the Public Administration Committee also envisages further regular information on insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to supply them with details of the number of passengers and tours sold each month, the total price of the tours sold and the amount of advances and sales for the tours and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agent has failed to fulfil one of the legal obligations to the insurance company, it will, according to the draft, call on it to remedy or prohibit it from entering into new contracts if the breach of the obligation could jeopardise the interests of customers.
The amendment is also to be newly modified by the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the grant to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which it will always submit until the end of April for the next year.
The application will include a report on the use of government money last year, a financing plan of expenditure and an outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, the petitioner of the law did not think the situation of what will happen if the insurance company terminates the contract.
It will not be allowed to hold tours, and clients who bought the trip before the insurance were terminated will lose it, according to the association.
The TA will suffer a significant loss in such a case and may even go bankrupt, even though its management was in good shape.
One way for travel agents to cope with such a situation will be a claim for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad and then we will act only as agencies in our market, said the association's vice-chairman, Jan Pope.
The draft amendment also includes the institute of a bank guarantee, but so ill-conspered that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, as the bank guarantee cannot be read at an unbounded amount.
Moreover, according to the association, the change in past practice is de facto unnecessary.
In the next two years, the whole law will need to be revised again, given the new EU directive.
There are now a total of 942 active insured travel agencies operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three CKs have ceased their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell trips worth about CZK 20 billion annually.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must make the push for improved humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with the German provincial prime ministers.
At the same time, it again appealed for the distribution of refugees who had already arrived in the EU among the 28 member countries.
We must do more to help the countries from which the refugees leave, or where they are staying after leaving the country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will work for decent conditions in refugee camps, such as in Jordan and Lebanon, the German Chancellor said that such a signal could also be higher financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU's international humanitarian organisations.
"Federal countries are also supporting the German government to promote a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to European countries," Merkel said.
In this context, the country's Prime Minister of Brandenburg, Dietmar Woidke, said at a press conference that he expected real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of EU refugees on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among others.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke in favour of speeding up the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible whether they have a chance to stay here.
It is also needed for the authorities to start integrating foreigners more quickly, the Prime Minister of Brandenburg said.
According to him, the majority of the money that Germany spends on the care of refugees should also be used to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
It will take more teachers to make the refugees manage German.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the refugees can be integrated, they can become an asset to us, he said.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in film
Matt Damon confronted the Afroameter filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, claiming that it was not necessary behind scenes.
During Sunday's episode of the HBO project, the Greenlight actor, booked in the series, interrupted the Brown series, emphasizing the need for alternative views about black protagonists in the script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting a movie and not when casting a show," Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted indignantly with disbelief and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments about the Martian got on the air.
Damon and Brown teamed up with well-known producer Ben Affleck and brothers Farrell to discuss the show's finalists.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they're going to behave in the character of Harmony," Brown said at the outset.
The only black character that is a hooker who's in a white pimp.
Drahých White's People producer championed the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted that their directing "came could end up giving us something we didn't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disapproval of Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at writing the clip, "Matt Damon interrupted the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SOWHERE that it hurts."
The tweet has earned over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 leks since it was released.
Damon's comment comes as accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After being killed by teenage Michael Brown as a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took a national effect and pushed lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colorful people.
In February, singer Prince made allusions to the movement, while presenting the nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Alba is still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recent leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented the statement in response to a question from Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the supervisor said.
Damon was recently reported to a list of entertainers, producers and media of moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the west.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
The professional mountaineer and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday to take home one million dollars.
In the competition, which had just finished its seventh season, none of the contestants had managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the final of this season, two men made it to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last hurdle was a 30-second climb for a more than 220 m long rope.
Britten graduated in the climb first, within the set limit, becoming the first contestant to surpass the draining 4 stretch at the American Ninja Warrior, however, overcame it by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview to News! News right after his hard-earned victory, and it was clear that he was still in shock at the $1 million prize win.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac E! said in response to his winnings.
"So suddenly . . . I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the run-in and why Britten would not receive any reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to complete the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the one who completes the track the fastest.
"If more competitors take part in the track, the winner will be awarded to the best time," said Weed.
Even if winning the main win would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
"I don't think he has a resoner.
He's glad he's managed to get what he's accomplished.
He received a warm welcome from fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.'
Geoff said to me, "If there was someone who could have beaten me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
The America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers only passed just past the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit Tigers, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the park.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are now in the last of the central division of the American League.
Only narrowly averted their defeat by the Tigers, beating Miness in Tuesday's game with a narrow 5-4 result at Target Field.
The twins missed a chance to get closer to the Houston Astros team and captivate the second wildcard in the American League.
Even for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z, which was so elusable for them during the second half of the season.
"Winn't win is always fun, and it doesn't matter what way," said Tigger Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his offensive roller opener, and Detroit scored three times in the first two inning, then took another in the sixth and ninth inning.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 of the hit and 3 runs.
It was only his third consecutive play in his last nine games.
"I want to finish the convincing results this year," Simon said.
"It's hard to get into a match when you're often on the bench and that's why I want to get into the game."
Tigers' baton Victor Martinez scored three shots and made 2 runs and his first drawn point since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-point game since the last game in June, scoring four times in a game against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned into it," Ausmus said.
"He looked good at practice, hit noticeably better and managed to bring it to the match."
With three circles at the end of the seventh inning, the Twin Towers won the best chance to return to the game.
The centre-slain, Byron Buxton, scored the shift with two points on the left side of the field.
Real-clabor Aaron Hicks scored a point with a set-up bat, and Simon outjured Brian Dozier before being traded by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy knocked out his only opponent, Mauer, and was in front of him by batter Miguel San, who hit the ball and ran around two bases, leaving right-handed Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on the bases and a chance to draw in the second inning, VerHagen managed to send the third sweeper over two bases.
Plouffe has already won 27 rounds over two bases this season and is reigning the league table.
Detroit held the ninth inning, Mauer scored two strichers, and Bruce Rondon gave a score of 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-handed one-on-leveiled Sana to three off-handed fits.
Detroit took the advantage to score points on Phil Hughes' game.
The Tigers acquired three rounds in the first two shifts against a retired right-handed man who came into the game after a more than a month's break due to a back muscle inflammation.
"I certainly didn't imagine a start like that," Hughes said, "but I already felt during my third shift that I was doing better to pitch."
After resisting the onslaught in the first inning, Hughes let one point in the second to the scorer Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for J.D. Martinez's right-handed field went to Victor Martinez, who was the first to run all the bases.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 streak.
Third-bothers Nick Castellanos followed him with a point to the right side of the field and scored with another bye, but Victor Martinez was dranged when he tried to make it to the third base.
The Tigers added a second-inning when pitcher James McCann and fielder Anthony Gose got them two and, by extension, one point, and the resulting scoreboard was 30.
"That got us in the knees," said the Twin Twin Manager Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won the pitch, finished in the third inning without any points and was replaced by right-his and A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three bases, scored six launches and four points.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the Tigers' right pitcher, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who is on the injured list thanks to the outstretched muscles in the shoulder from mid-August, is expected to start in Wednesday's game.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who will be back from injury and take on the Twin Towers.
Since Norris was traded for left-handed pitcher David Price on June 30, he has scored 1-1 after 4 games.
However, he has not yet played since August 20 because of a stretched muscle.
The Tigers and the Twin Towers will play their third match at the Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will be opposed by Minnesot's left pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, whose task is Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should be involved in attraction of foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," the Central Group's Head of Deepening the Overall Reform said regarding the 16th meeting.
Promoting opening up in the nasal reforms will give new impetus and vitality, it will also provide new room for economic growth, Xi reports.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market regulatory access, the loosening of border control policy, support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and reorganise the registration residency.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up to identify sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through the test programmes.
This step is significant as it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, the provision of a legal business environment and make the market more open, the statement says.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to firms and make sure that the firms themselves decide how to run their business.
The statement also states that China will allow the border areas to discover new cross-border economic cooperation models and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector to more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies that are financed from abroad and will provide them with better services," the statement reads.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card," thanks to optimizing requirements and simplifying the application process.
Provision of lawyers' rights to practise and develop professional judges and the prosecutor was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary Region, new bed wards may be created.
According to the Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region, Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current capacity of bed wards of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
In the region, however, there are also possibilities of expanding care.
For example, in the surgical department departments, there could be a one-day surgical centre, where, according to the set concept, surgical procedures that do not require more than 24 hours of hospitalization would be performed.
In which specific hospitals should be workplaces focused on one-day surgery is not yet clear.
In the skin department of the hospital Karlovy Vary, a laser centre could be created with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalic centre to look after patients with a brain condition who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and be an integral part of the anaesthetic-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the Ostrov hospital, where such care already exists.
Another bed capacity that appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region is the after-care bed and especially the bed with long-term ill patients' treatment (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and should be closely connected to acute care beds.
Part of this facility should act as rehabilitation beds and part such as classic LDN beds, the concept recommends.
As he points out, the aftercare beds are mainly absent from the hospital in Karlovy Vary.
There, you could use the abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least in the Karlovy Vary Region, there are no social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
There is a shortage of these beds throughout the country, so it could also serve for other regions as the so-called Alzheimercentrum.
Hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called downstream beds, for which European subsidies will be mobilised.
"These are beds that will follow the fields of supespecialized care and will form a space for translating patients after the procedure, for example, after the procedure, for example, after cardiac, neurosurgery, transplantation or other procedure," the regional concept of inpatient care describes.
New services could also be offered in the area of psychiatric care.

TikTok hides undesirable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18
Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the banned falun Gong religious group, The Guardian reported.
The documents, which caught up with the publication, show that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) uses the app to promote the goals of China's foreign policy abroad.
Most of the violations related to China's policy fall under the "incitement of hatred."
In each case, TikTok places inappropriate posts in a context that fits the general rules so that the social network doesn't look censored.
For example, the ban on criticizing China's socialist system falls under a blanket ban on "criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc."
The ban on the mention of incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the "distortion of the history of China or other countries."
The document also lists the banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen," including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, U.S. Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated in the document.
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.
Posts from the first category are removed by the administrators of the social network and can lead to a user's blocking.
Not too severe violations fall into the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to algorithms TikTok.
Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that the rules are outdated and no longer apply: "We are now using a localized approach for moderation, as well as attracting independent local experts."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Producing Center.
The "Producing Center" is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Producing Center" agree with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be placed without agreement, Bogdanov reports.
Asked if TikTok can speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says that he has seen such publications.
The founder of our Didgital agency Roman Saripov agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for users TikTok lists in the user agreement: you can not post shocking content that discriminates and so on."
But under these rules, you can sum up any content that moderators don't like, notes saripov.
The agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
Under the user agreement, only people over the age of 13 can use TikTok.
Administrators of the social network check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, their account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019. ByteDance has opened an office in Moscow on the territory of Coworking WeWork.

Barcelona blackmail Neymar
Spanish Barcelona and its former footballer Brazilian Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the transfer of the striker to the French "Paris Saint-Germain".
The case almost went to court, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Themis.
Otherwise, they refuse to return him.
Neymar and his dodgy father, who is also the Brazilian's agent, had an interesting focus: under the agreement with Barca, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later the forward was in PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Moreover, the Brazilian's lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payment.
When the Catalan capital became aware of Neymar's claims, Barcelona filed a counter-claim.
The Blues insist that the bonus was due to run the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club considers that the player was entitled to only a quarter of 40 million euros and demand the return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and Barca almost agreed on the return of the "prodigal" player to the bosom of Catalonia.
True, the deal fell through, but the hope for a reverse transition forward remains.
And so, as Sports reports. Ru, citing insiders, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in the pre-trial order, it will exclude the possibility of the return of the Brazilian.
Neymar himself wants to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans will buy him back.

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly understood.
Among the most famous - pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are well researched and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (among them cardiovascular, some cancers).
Known sources of phytoestrogens - all legumes (the most popular - soy), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such dietary supplements can not act as a full-fledged replacement for natural hormones.
The possible harm from such additives cannot be ruled out.
For example, the background of their intake may reduce the production of their own hormones due to the fact that the body enters too many analogues from the outside.

Hydrometeorological Center named the right people's signs
In Russia, there are many popular signs on which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometeorological Center checked all the signs that supposedly work.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can really be trusted, however, in the short term.
As Roman Wilfand, the scientific director of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia, said, if the sun is red at the time of sunset, the next day will really be a nice one, as our ancestors noticed.
And if the celestial luminary is white, the next day it will rain.
The second working omen is based on bird watching.
More often talk about swallows, if they fly low, it is usually rain.
This is explained simply - when the humidity is high, the moshkara wet the wings and feathered are forced to decline to hunt insects, writes TASS.
There are national signs on different continents.

Unidentified oil slicks found on beaches in northeast Brazil
Oil slicks of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
Pollution hotspots were scattered over two thousand kilometers of coastline.
Reports of the first oil slicks detected began to arrive on September 2.
However, their number, as well as territorial coverage, continued to increase every day until Thursday.
The Brazilian Environment Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turned out that they are all identical and it is about crude oil.
The state oil corporation Petrobras, which was given the samples for analysis, said that they do not correspond to the oil extracted from the fields in Brazil.
"It's thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after the tanks are cleared.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it got into the ocean current," Rozherio Almeida, coordinator of the oil workers' union of Pernambuco and Paraiba, told brazilian news portal G1.
He added that despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continue to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the northeast, environmentalists found nine sea turtles completely covered in oil film.
And only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute will work with Petrobras to clean up the contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the institute's specialists recommend tourists and local residents to bypass the oil slicks and notify about all the detected pollution hotspots.

A 26-year-old unemployed man has now been detained.
Russians have nothing to save for themselves - V. Matviyenko
Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko believes that Russians do not have enough savings to make the country fully earned a bill on a guaranteed pension product.
The practice of increasing pensions at the expense of personal savings in the world is quite common.
It is another matter how timely its introduction is with us.
"In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has incomes, of which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension provision in the future," Matviyenko said.
According to the speaker, Russians cannot understand the mechanisms of pension formation and accrual, as "constant changes in this area have completely confused them".
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system governing its legislation.
"Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to improve the size of pensions and social security of citizens.
But steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account the domestic realities," Matviyenko told RIA Novosti.
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the bill on the guaranteed pension product) will develop, then there should be several basic principles, including voluntaryness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state to ensure the safety of pension savings.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance announced the submission of a bill on the Guaranteed Pension Product (GPP) for approval.
Among its main elements are the exclusively voluntary procedure of joining citizens to the system of savings, guaranteeing the safety of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registration of savings accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.

Spider-Man is an iconic figure.
This is a hero whose story affects all generations and audiences around the world," his press release reads.
Faigy recalled that Sony is also creating its own film universe, built just around Spider-Man.
"It so happened that he is the only super-strength hero who found himself in different movie universes.
So while Sony continues to develop its own Spidy universe, the future may present unexpected surprises," he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted an excerpt from the movie "The Wolf of Wall Street" on his Instagram account, in which leonardo's hero DiCaprio shouts "I'm not leaving!"
Information about the contradictions between the companies appeared in August.

But that didn't suit Sony.
News of the possible departure of his favorite superhero from the Marvel cinematic universe has angered many devoted fans.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.

Expert told why it is necessary to give up tea in tea bags
A team of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found that when brewing a tea bag in a cup in five minutes gets more than ten billion particles of microplastics.
The packaged drink can also be added to the sawn-off particle, food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonova told Nation News.
According to the agronomist, the consumer can not get reliable information about the composition of packaged tea - the manufacturer can add there ingredients that will not be specified on the package.
Sawdust at the end of the season is not thrown away, so they can be in tea.
"Moreover, tea plants are not always included in tea bags," Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to stop using such a drink in favor of tea on weight, which is sold in specialty stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaged tea lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles are heated to high temperatures, because of which they can begin to emit harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - in such a drink will be the least additives," - the expert said.

It's time to establish interregional ties
The Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions on their existing business development programs and the legalization of the self-employed, as well as on the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve the existing legislation.
"To date, communication between the regions is not well established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the senators' visitation was not identified the issue of lack of information about regional programs of entrepreneurship development in the country as a whole," Andrei Kutepov said.
In the annex to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and aggregated data from regions with proposals and problems (available to the editorial board).
In addition to the relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions were also sent to the heads of regional executive authorities.

The self-employed continue to be taken out of the shadows
According to the regional authorities, a number of changes in the current legislation should be made in order to better support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity" because it was "most consistent with the content of public services to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens".
In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to amend the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities on finishing and repairing living quarters, cottage buildings, conducting physical training classes.
The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the Mercury veterinary system.

All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of concrete bills," Andrei Kutepov said.

Supplies of "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times
The Russian government has estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries subject to the Russian food embargo has decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, 31,000 tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries in the first half of 2019 against 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period of 2013, Interfax reports.
At the same time, the value of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million, respectively.
These are the supply of goods that have not been embargoed.
According to the report, the volumes of prohibited products were compensated by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia.
At the end of August, the government extended to December 31, 2020 the validity of the rules of destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited to import into Russia as part of counter-sanctions.
The document, posted on the official portal of legal information, noted that the rules were extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.

Putin's decree on the destruction of "sanctions" (products that fell under the food embargo, which Moscow imposed in response to anti-Russian sanctions of the West) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government allowed the destruction of "sanctioned" food in any legitimate way.
As Western sanctions continued, Russia also extended its response.

Chile began to build a telescope worth 1 billion euros
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, construction of the dome of the building, where the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope) telescope will be located, has officially begun this week, while the most expensive and ambitious terrestrial astronomical project will be located.
Its total value is estimated by ESO to exceed one billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-breaking large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflective surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters will help E-ELT get the first detailed photos of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and look for Earth's twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the vicinity of the Sgr A, a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has just begun, mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total value was about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
